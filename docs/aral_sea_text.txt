# Introduction
In the last years, an increasing scientific interest has been awoken in terms of 
the interaction between aerosols and the elements of the hydrological cycle 
[@Ng2017, 1]. Precipitation patterns and their influence on human’s 
living environment can be connected with a variety of ecological, economic and 
social challenges on different spatial extents [@Boucher2013, 573 ff.]. 
Especially in semi-arid and arid regions changes in rainfall rates can affect 
health of local residents [@Issanova2015, 3213ff.]. Where water is an 
already scarce resource, further decreases will promote rising vulnerability to 
external threats (ibid.). Regarding this, the Aral Sea region can be seen as a 
first-class example for investigations between aerosols and rainfall activities 
[@Shen2019, 1]. With the desertification of the Aral Sea it has been 
subject to substantial changes in terms of water availability 
[@Groll2019, 1]. Deserts contain a high proportion of mineral aerosols, 
which may initiate climatological mechanisms of high complexity and, ultimately, 
a shift in precipitation rates [@Boucher2013, 573 ff.]. Still, it is hard 
to quantify the effects on other environmental parameters [@Ng2017, 1]. 
The relationship between aerosols and cloud microphysics as well as precipitation 
patterns remains one of the biggest uncertainties in climate studies [@Altaratz2013, 1].
Aerosols play a major role in changes of the earth’s energy budget 
[@Ng2017, 1] and can be seen as an important component of global 
climate [@Carrico2003, 1]. There exist four major terrestrial sources for 
atmospheric aerosols which, based on their chemical composition, either absorb 
or scatter incoming solar and terrestrial radiation [@Sharif2015, 657f]. 
These direct effects may cool the surface and affect evaporation 
[@Ng2017, 1]. Also, aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) 
leading to more and smaller droplets, which is called the first indirect aerosol 
effect [@Costantino2010, 1]. The result is a suppression of 
precipitation, while the second indirect effect prolongs the cloud’s lifetime 
through the prevention of coalescence favouring the occurrence of extreme events 
[@Ng2017, 2]. By heating the cloud, the coverage area is reduced, 
again leading to a higher amount of radiation on the ground. This attenuates 
surface evaporation and further decreases rainfall (ibid.). A number of studies 
showed the presence of a strong seasonality in regard to aerosol concentration 
in Central Asia [@Ge2016, 62ff.;@Li2018, 2ff.]. The highest 
values occur in spring while the lowest concentrations have been measured in 
winter (ibid.). However, some studies suggest the indicated perturbation of the 
hydrological cycle to be more distinct in some places than in others [@Ng2017, 2].
The goal of this study is to analyse temporal and spatial variations of aerosols 
in the Aral Sea region in relation to precipitation patterns. Following a prior 
seminar work regarding the analysis of aerosol and cloud microphysical properties, 
it continues striving for an adequate estimation of the relationship between 
hydro-climatological parameters. Therefore, the analysis consists of the 
investigation of potential trends, their strength and direction in regard to 
aerosol concentration to rainfall rates. In order to display the overall 
effects, cloud microphysical parameters will be included as well as the 
atmosphere’s relative humidity because of its critical role on rainfall 
variability [@Altaratz2013, 1f.; @Carrico2003, 2]. Some studies 
suggest high rain rates to be associated with a rising aerosol concentration 
[@Boucher2013, 4]. Otherwise, contrary results have been observed as 
well [@Ng2017, 1ff.]. In general, time and space seem to be crucial 
[@Grandey2014, 5678ff.]. The hygroscopicity of aerosols cause the 
relative humidity to be one of the most important drivers for the observed 
relationship between AOD and rainfall [@Ng2017, 2f.]. When it 
reaches a certain concentration, it can alter the results of correlation 
analyses mainly through two effects [@Altaratz2013, 1f.]. First, relative 
humidity may cause, dependend on the aerosols’ chemical properties, substantial 
growth of the particles in an humid environment [@Carrico2003, 1], 
leading to coalescence of the droplets [@Ng2017, 2ff.]. This 
depicts a rather positive relation between the variables 
[@Grandey2014, 5678]. Second, wet scavenging of aerosols through rainfall 
can occur in a mostly convective environment [@Grandey2014, 5680ff.]. It 
acts as an aerosol sink and results in a negative relationship between the 
aerosol concentration and precipitation or rather relative humidity (ibid.). 
Consequently, a negative correlation may not only reflect suppressed 
precipitation [@Ng2017, 9]. Both effects demonstrate the importance 
of the atmospheres’ humidity in questions of aerosol-precipitation relationships 
and thus will be evaluated in the following study.

# Data and Methods
## Study area
The Aral Sea basin is located in the border region between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan 
(57 – 67 °E, 42 – 49 °N) and acts as the tail-end lake of the contributing rivers 
Amu Darya and Syr Darya (Figure 1). The study area is part of the global dust belt 
and shows typical features of a temperate continental climate with semi-arid to 
arid conditions. The summers are short and hot with a mean of 28.2 $^\circ C$ while 
winters are long and cold with a mean of -3.6 $^\circ C$. Precipitation rates are quite 
low with a mean of about 82.1 $mm/year$ and a maximum during winter [@Gaybull2012, 287]. 
Strong winds are often to be recorded in the study area [@Issanova2015, 3213f.].
The Aral Sea once has been the fourth largest lake on earth covering a water volume 
of 1.093 $km^3$ in 1960 [@Gaybull2012, 286]. Since then, it has been gradually 
shrinking due to overexploitation of its natural resources by water abstraction 
for irrigation agriculture as well as the impacts of climate change [@Ge2016, 2; @Shen2019, 2031].
In the year 2003, it finally split into eastern and western parts. 
The exposed lake bed consists of salt soils and loose sand dunes turning the 
former southern and western part of the lake into the Aralkum desert
[@Shen2019, 2031f.; @Shen2016, 624] which comprises of 57.500 $km^2$ [@Opp2019, 3].
The landscape is characterized by frequent salt and sand dust storms which may 
bear several threats to the ecosystem and local human’s health [@Ge2016, 4]. 
It has been stated that the spatial and temporal dust deposition variability 
is highly significant [@Opp2019, 1ff.]. 

## Satellite products
MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data currently is collected 
by two platforms (TERRA and AQUA) orbiting the Earth on a Sun-synchronous polar 
orbit. It measures solar and thermal radiation in 36 bands in resolutions ranging 
from 250 $m$ to 1 $km$. For this study, daily resolution Level-2 data were used for 
aerosol (MOD/MYD04) [@Levy2017] and cloud (MOD/MYD06) [@Platnick2017] parameters 
as well as the corresponding geolocation files (MOD/MYD03) [@Team2012]. 


### Aerosol properties
The aerosol optical depth (AOD) were retrieved from the MOD/MYD04 data product based on the Deep Blue 
algorithm (DB) described by @Hsu2004 and @Hsu2006. DB uses wavelengths in the 
blue spectrum to overcome the phenomenon of absorbing aerosols darkening the 
reflectance measured at the sensor over bright surfaces making it more suitable 
for aerosol retrievals over bright surfaces such as deserts [@Hsu2004]. It is 
applied to clear-sky snow-free pixels over land only and uses the 412, 470/490, 650, 860, 1240 
and \linebreak 2110 $\mu m$ spectral bands on a final pixel size of 10 x 10 $km$ [@Hsu2013]. 

_Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD):_ The calculation 
of AOD is based on a established lookup table which differentiates for 
several regions around the globe based on dominant aerosol modes found by empirical 
measurements [@Hsu2004]. Two different retrieval techniques can be applied: 
For moderate dust loadings with AOD < 0.7 the algorithm uses a two-channel 
technique to retrieve aerosol parameters based at 412 and 470/490 $\mu m$. Under 
heavy dust loadings with AOD > 0.7 a three-channel technique with the additional
670 $\mu m$ band may retrieve values for the combination 412  vs. 670 $\mu m$
and 470/490 vs. 670 $\mu m$. 

### Cloud properties
The algorithm to retrieve cloud optical and microphysical parameters at a nominal 
resolution of 1 $km$ makes use of the 645, 1640, 2130 and 3750 $\mu m$ channels over
land during daytime. It is applied to cloud overcast pixels only and differentiates 
the calculation according to the dominant phase of the cloud [@Baum2012]. 
Additionally, information of the surface albedo is included in the algorithm since
cloud reflectance is altered due to the underlying surface characteristics. 
Here, only the parameters describing the cloud’s microphysics (COT, CER and CWP) 
are extracted.

_Cloud Effective Radius (CER) and Cloud Optical Thickness (COT):_ CER and COT are 
derived from water-absorbing bands of MODIS (1.6, 2.1, 3.7 $\mu m$) coupled with 
non-absorbing bands (0.65, 0.86 and 1.2 $\mu m$) [@Platnick2003]. The algorithm 
uses a radiative transfer model to calculate a reflected intensity field for
combinations of CER and COT. Both parameters are then retrieved based on the measured
reflectance. With the introduction of the algorithm version C6 the retrieval of 
cloud parameters for optical thin clouds has been enabled [@Platnick2017]. 
For this study the data layers which retrieve CER and COT based on the relation 
between 2.1 $\mu m$ and 0.65, 0.86 and 1.2 $\mu m$ were used.

_Cloud Water Path (CWP):_ The CWP is directly linked to CER and COT and 
refers to the total liquid water amount found in the atmospheric column 
above a given pixel. It can be calculated in a simplified manner by use of Formula 2:

\begin{equation}
CWP = y * CER * COT
\end{equation}

This form of the calculation is beneficial for satellite-based measurements, 
since CWP can be estimated with information on COT and CER only. The term $y$ 
is either determined by adiabatic assumptions [@Wood2006] or the assumption of a 
vertically homogeneous water column [@Stephens1978] becoming either the ratio 
$^5/_9$ or $^2/_3$, respectively.

### Precipitation
_Precipitation (P):_ Monthly sums of precipitation are derived from the CHIRPS
dataset. This dataset is established by taking long-term monthly average data
from ground stations in conjunction with observations from five satellite missions
to establish a local regression model with a moving window for each grid cell of
0.05° in size [@Funk2015, 3f.]. The independent variables in the local regressions
consist always of the longitude and latidue information as well as one to three additional
variables representing either the local elevation, the slope or satelite observations.
Potential residuals in comparison to the FAO climate normals are interpolated
using inverse distance weighting and are than added to the local estimates [@Funk2015, 3].
In a last step, for every pixel the five nearest ground stations are used to apply
another inverse distance weighting algorithm. Here, an estimate of the decorrelation slope
from the predicted precipitation and the observed precipitation at the neighbouring stations
are used to calculated a weighted average [@Funk2015, 3].

### Relative Humidity
_Relative Humidity (RH):_ RH is retrived using the ERA-5 reanalysis dataset processed by
the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [@Forecasts2017]. 
This dataset combines observations and model predictions to get a comprehensive 
model of global atmospheric conditions at small time steps and a nominal resoultion
of 31km at the ground, however the data has been regridded to 0.25°. The atmosphere 
is modeled in 137 vertical levels from the surface to 1 Pa. Here, we used the 
monthly aggregates of RH only for the first seven atmospheric layers (1000 hPa - 850 hPa) 
since the other datasets were also summarized to monthly aggregates. 850 Pa was 
considered an appropiate height level, since local aerosol trasnports in the region
are merely reported to be found above 5 km in height [@Chen2013]. 

## Methodology
AOD and the cloud parameters were extracted from the respective MODIS datasets 
using the HEG-Tool (HDF-EOS To GeoTIFF Conversion Tool). It enables a selection of the 
cloud and aerosol properties clipping the data directly to the area of interest which 
is leaned on the shape of the study area used by [@Ge2016]. The cloud parameters
(at 6km nominal resoultion) were resampled to the 10km nominal resoultion of the AOD
dataset. 
The observations of single MODIS overflights were then aggregated to a monthly 
temporal-resolution, and means were calculated for four different seasons 
(Spring: March, April, May; Summer: June, July, August; Autumn: September, October, 
November; Winter: December, January, February) 
for every year between 2003 to 2018.

The CHIRPS dataset already represents monthly aggregates. The cell values were resampled
to the 10km resoultion of the MODIS data and seasonal aggregates were calculated as described
above. For RH, the process was basically identical, except that the median was 
calculated across the seven vertival layers, before the data was resampled to the 
same resoultion as the other datasets.

To retrieve the correlation between AOD and P and to generate insights to the underlying
processes we conduct a number of correlation analysis between these two parameters,
while eleminating the influence of cloud parameteres and RH. For this approach,
we firstly cheked if the data fullfills the assumptions to calcualte Pearsons correlation.
All variables are continous in form. Pearsons correlation additionally is sensitive
for outliers. Similiarily to other studys we thus excluded exceptional high AOD values
above 0.3. Also, we assume linear relationships between the variables for values below the 
AOD threshold of 0.3. We then calculated the correlation coefficient betwenn AOD and P
while controlling for any other variable. This is achieved by calculating the partial correlation. 
Partial correlation is used as a measure of the linear dependence between two variables 
while controlling for the influences of a third.
In fact, not the original values of AOD and P are fitted, but rather the residuals
which were calculated by using the control variable as a predictor. Thus, only the 
proportion of variance which cannot be explained by the control variable is subject to the
correlation analysis [@Salkind2010].
This approach has been chosen by a number of recent studies investigating relationships
between aerosols and cloud microphysics as well as precipitations and seems reasonable to 
achive both, investigating the "true" realtionship between AOD and P in a complex field
of interviening processes and effects and to deliver indications for the dominant processes
driving this relationship [@Engstrom2010; @Gryspeerdt2014; @Ng2017].

The results of this analysis are presented on a pixel basis for each season to 
display spatial and temporal differences. Additionally, the correlation of all 
pixels which show a significant relationship at the 95% confidence interval 
is calculated to investigate the overall direction and strength of 
correlation between aerosol and cloud parameters [@Alam2010, 1170f.].

# Results
## Temporal and spatial variations of P and RH

__Temporal and spatial dynamics for P_
During the time series under study (2003 - 2018) we can observe a varying 
pattern for precipitation (figure x). In 2003 we observe relativly high 
precipitation rates with an average above 200 mm per pixel and a median even 
slightly higher than the mean. This amount of high precipitation rates from the 
year 2003 is not reached again during the time series, instead most of the years 
indicate a mean value of precipitation below 150 mm per pixel. The years 2008, 
2011, and 2014 show exceptional low precipitation which is in accordance with 
other studies which report this years as being drought years in Central Asia 
[@Quelle]. In 2015 and 2016 precipitation is higher than during the other years, 
however the high precipitation rate of 2003 is not reached.
Concerning the intra-annual pattern of precipitation, we observe the highest 
rates in March and April as well as another peak during November and December of
about 19 mm per pixel. During the summer months of July to September we observe 
the lowest precipitation rates with means about 5 mm. The seasonality of 
precipitation is thus clearly visible and is in accordance with the seasonal 
divison we chose here for our analysis.
The spatial pattern of P shows that higher precipitation rates are found above
the Aral Sea and Aralkum dessert (figure x) as well as in the South-East of the 
study area during the first and fourth season. The second and third season are
charchterized by very low precipitation rates, especially in the South of the 
study area. The linear trend analysis indicates significant linear trends only 
during the first season in the South-East of the study area. Here, moderate
to high negative slopes seem to dominate the trend (about -2 to -5 mm/year). 
During the second season we also observe moderate to high decrease of precipitation
rate close to the Aral Sea and its Northern neighbourhood. During the third and
fourth season we barley observe patterns of significan linear trends.

__Temporal and spatial dynamics for RH_
Concerning the inter-annual dynamic of relative humiditiy, we osberve a general 
decrease of RH per pixel during the first few years. Similiar to P, the highest 
level of RH is reached in 2003 with a mean value of 50%. In 2010 and 2014, we 
observe RH values below 40%, and in 2012 and 2018 RH reaches only about 42%. 
With the exception of 2014, we do not see the gravity of the drought years of 
2008 and 2011 in the dynamic of RH. During most other years RH usually reaches 
between 43 - 46%, however, in 2015 and 2016 the mean is about 48%, in the same 
years we also observed relativly high precipitation rates.
The intra-annual dynamic of RH follows a very clear seasonal pattern with the 
lowest RH (~31%) found in the warm summer months June to August. RH is maximized
during December to March, with levels between 55 - 58%.
The spatial pattern of RH shows higher values throught the study area for the 
first and foruth season. For the second and foruth season, the pattern is very similar
with the lowest RH found in the South-East and a positive gradient towards the 
North-West of the studyarea. However, the values during the second season are 
substantially lower than compared to the third. Significant linear trends are 
only found during the second season South of the Aral Sea. Here, low negative
slopes dominate the trend (about -0.3%/year).

## Correlation analysis between AOD and P
As indicated in the methods section, we analysed the partial correlation between
AOD and P controlling for three parameters of cloud microphysics and RH. As a 
baseline we also calculated the correlation without any controling variable. We 
excluded all pixels for which there were no observations in AOD at any time step
in order to capture the complete time series of the remainng pixels. This areas
are indicated in grey color in the figures below. 

_Baseline correlation_
Areas with missing values are concentrated around the Aral Sea for all seasons. 
During the first and third season, the number of missing observations is higher 
than during the other seasons. For the first season, we observe a pattern of 
strongly negative correlation in the center of the studyarea and South of the 
Aral Sea. We also observe some, though non-significant, positive correlations in
the North and the far South-East of the studyarea. During the second season,
there are only very few locations with significant correlations. In general, the
picture is very patchy with positive and negative correlations distrubted fairly
random in the studyarea, especially next to the Aral Sea. In the third season we
observe a comprehensive patch of negative correlations in the North of the studyarea
and positive correlations in the South. However, the positive correlations are 
not significant. A similar pattern, though larger in size extending to the South
is observed during the foruth season. These correlations are significant and negative
an generally between -0.4 and -0.7.

_Partial Correlation controlling for CER_
Concerning the spatial distribution of the correlations, the pattern is very 
similar to the baseline correlation analysis. However, we observe slight increases
in the amplitute of the signficant negative correlations for the seasons (between
-0.6 and -0.85).

_Partial Correlation controlling for COT_
The amplitude and spatial distribution is very similar to the preceeding correlation
analysis. However, for the third and fourth season the total number of significant
correlations decreases and the comprehensive areas of negative correlations
are observed to become more patchy.

_Partial Correlation controlling for CWP_
For CWP again, the main patterns compared to the other analysis do not change. 
However, there seems to be a slight increase in the negative correlations during 
the fourth season.

_Partial Correlation controlling for RH_
When controlling for RH, some changes can be observed. In the first season,
the size of the patch of significant negative correlations around the Aral Sea
and Aralkum dessert is substantially reduced. The same finding holds true for
the Norther patch of negative correlations in the third season. In the fourth 
season, directly North of the Aral Sea, we observe fewer significant negative 
correlations, however, the comprehensive patch in the Center of the studyarea
can still be observed. In general, when controlling for RH, there seems to be 
a shift into the direction of positive correlations, because the positive correlations
increase in amplitude without reaching the level of significance.

_Partial Correlation controlling for CWP, COT, CWP, and RH_
When controlling for all variables, the correlations patterns get more patchy during 
all seasons, which means in large proportions of the studyarea we observe non-significant
postive and negative correlations in fairly random patterns next to each other.
The exceptions are a comprehensive patch of negative correlations in the North 
of the studyarea in the third season, though its size is substantially reduced
compared to the baseline analysis, as well as the comprehensive patch
of negative correlations in the Center of the studyarea during the fourth season.
Compared to the analysis controling for RH only, the non-significant positive
correlations also seem to decrease in amplitutde.

_Analysis of signficant correlations_
Figure xx shows the correlations of selected pixels which showed significant correlations
for all four seasons and based on the controlling scenario. For all seasons and 
analysis we observe negative correlations between AOD and P between -0.1 and -0.38.
The correlation values for the second season are substantially closer to 0 than 
compared to all other seasons which can be easily explained by the very small number
of pixels which showed significant correlations during this seasons. Thus, the 
results for the second season are omitted hereafter.
For the first and third season, controlling for parameters of cloud microphysics
seem to increase the negative correlations compared to the baseline analysis while
controling for RH delivers smaller correlations. This observations is not valid 
for the fourth season, where controlling for RH increases the correlation 
coefficient, while controling for cloud microphysics shows little to no effects.
When all variables are controlled for, we observe no effects on the correlation 
coefficient for the first and fourth season. In the third season, conrolling
for all variables together decreases the coefficient from -0.38 to -0.28.
