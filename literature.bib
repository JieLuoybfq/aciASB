abstract = {Climate change scenarios predict that Central Asia may experience an increase in the frequency and magnitude of temperature and precipitation extremes by the end of the 21st century, but the response regularity of different types of vegetation to climate extremes is uncertain. Based on remote-sensed vegetation index and in-situ meteorological data for the period of 2000–2012, we examined the diverse responses of vegetation to climate mean/extremes and differentiated climatic and anthropogenic influence on the vegetation in Central Asia. Our results showed that extensive vegetation degradation was related to summer water deficit as a result of the combined effect of decreased precipitation and increased potential evapotranspiration. Water was a primary climatic driver for vegetation changes regionally, and human-induced changes in vegetation confined mainly to local areas. Responses of vegetation to water stress varied in different vegetation types. Grasslands were most responsive to water deficit followed by forests and desert vegetation. Climate extremes caused significant vegetation changes, and different vegetation types had diverse responses to climate extremes. Grasslands represented a symmetric response to wet and dry periods. Desert vegetation was more responsive during wet years than in dry years. Forests responded more strongly to dry than to wet years due to a severe drought occurred in 2008. This study has important implications for predicting how vegetation ecosystems in drylands respond to climate mean/extremes under future scenarios of climate change.},

abstract = {Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been widely applied for the remote sensing of aerosol optical depth (AOD) because the MODIS sensor features a short revisit period and a moderate spatial resolution. The Dense Dark Vegetation (DDV) method is the most popular retrieval method. However, the DDV method can only be used to retrieve the AOD with high precision when the surface reflectance in the visible spectrum is low, such as over dense vegetation or water. To obtain precise AOD values in areas with higher reflectance, such as arid areas, Land Surface Reflectance (LSR) must be estimated accurately. This paper proposes a method of estimating LSR for AOD retrieval over arid areas from long-term series of MODIS images. According to the atmospheric parameters (AOD and water vapor), the clearest image without clouds was selected from the long-term series of continuous MODIS images. Atmospheric correction was conducted based on similar ground-measured atmospheric parameters and was used to estimate the LSR and retrieve the AOD at adjacent times. To validate this method, aerosol inversion experiments were performed in northern Xinjiang, in which the inverted AOD was compared to ground-measured AOD and MODIS aerosol products (MOD04). The AOD retrieved using the new algorithm was highly consistent with the AOD derived from ground-based measurements, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. Additionally, 82.22{\%} of the points fell within the expected error defined by NASA. The precision of the retrieved AOD data was better than that of MOD04 AOD products over arid areas.},

abstract = {Land surface reflectance (LSR) and aerosol types are the two main factors that affect aerosol inversions over land. According to LSR determination methods, Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products are produced using the Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT) algorithms. Five aerosol types that are determined from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground measurements are used to describe the global distribution of aerosol types in each algorithm. To assess the influence of LSR and the method used to determine aerosol type from aerosol retrievals, 10-km global aerosol products that cover 2013 are selected for validation using Level 2.0 aerosol observations from 175 AERONET sites. The variations in the retrieval accuracy of the DB and DT algorithms for different LSR values are analyzed by combining them with a global 10-km LSR database. Meanwhile, the adaptability of the MODIS products over areas covered with different aerosols is also explored. The results are as follows. (1) Compared with DT retrievals, the DB algorithm yields lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolut error (MAE) values, and a greater number of appropriate sample points fall within the expected error (EE). The DB algorithm shows higher overall reliability; (2) The aerosol retrieval accuracy of the DB and DT algorithms decline irregularly as the surface reflectance increases; the DB algorithm displays relatively high accuracy; (3) Both algorithms have a high retrieval accuracy over areas covered by weak absorbing aerosols, whereas dust aerosols and continental aerosols produce a low retrieval accuracy. The DB algorithm shows good retrieval results for most aerosols, but a lower accuracy for strong absorbing aerosols.},

abstract = { Ground based dust monitoring is an important tool for the long-term monitoring of aeolian sediment transport in Central Asia as it provides valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of dust deposition as well as grants access to the transported material for further analyses. Between 2006 and 2012 such a monitoring was carried out in the Turan lowland to analyze the effects of the newly formed Aralkum. The detected spatial and temporal dust deposition variability was significant and encourages further studies. The dust deposition increased over time, which correlates with a decreasing trend in precipitation, increasing wind speeds and a shift towards northern winds. More than 50{\%} of all dust samples collected exceed the health based deposition threshold and the most intense dust storm events reached ground level deposition rates of up to 150 g/m 2 per hour. This study showed the impact of the Aralkum, but also that the Kyzylkum is a far more active dust source. With regard to climate change and an increasing aridity in the region it can be expected that the aeolian dust transport will continue to increase, making a wide-spread monitoring program even more important. },

abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore the aerosol optical depth (AOD) – an indicator of air quality, based on satellite data over Central Asia. Due to limited studies and lack of knowledge regarding AOD variations over this region, five countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and fifteen sites including the capital cities were selected for the analysis. Long-term Aqua-MODIS Collection 6.1 Deep Blue (DB) AOD observations at 10 km spatial resolution were obtained for 2002–2017 and the {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent (AE) was calculated using spectral AOD observations. AOD and AE were explored based on seasonal and inter-annual scale. The relationship between aerosol loading and economic indicator (gross domestic product) was also analyzed. Highest frequencies of low AOD and high AE were observed in all countries. Average AOD (AE) values during the study period were 0.17 ± 0.09 (1.29 ± 0.17) for Kazakhstan, 0.11 ± 0.13 (1.41 ± 0.13) for Kyrgyzstan, 0.17 ± 0.14 (1.36 ± 0.18) for Tajikistan, 0.20 ± 0.10 (1.10 ± 0.28) for Turkmenistan, and 0.18 ± 0.09 (1.18 ± 0.24) for Uzbekistan. Summer season experienced highest aerosol loading over Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, whereas spring season experienced highest aerosol loading over Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan possibly due to the influence of less precipitation and dust from the arid regions. All fifteen cities selected in this study exhibited increasing aerosol load. Aerosol types based on the relationship between AOD and AE were investigated, results suggested the clean continental aerosol as a major aerosol type over the region, whereas the contribution of mixed aerosols was observed during spring and summer seasons. This study suggests for establishment of ground-based aerosol monitoring stations network and inclusions of modeling works to understand the complex nature of aerosol over this vast landmass.},

abstract = {The semi-direct effects of dust aerosols are analyzed over eastern Asia using 2 years (June 2002 to June 2004) of data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) scanning radiometer and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite, and 18 years (1984 to 2001) of International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data. The results show that the water path of dust-contaminated clouds is considerably smaller than that of dust-free clouds. The mean ice water path (IWP) and liquid water path (LWP) of dusty clouds are less than their dust-free counterparts by 23.7{\%} and 49.8{\%}, respectively. The long-term statistical : relationship derived from ISCCP also confirms that there is significant negative correlation between dust storm index and ISCCP cloud water path (CWP). These results suggest that dust aerosols warm clouds, increase the evaporation of cloud droplets and further reduce the CWP, the so-called semi-direct effect. The semi-direct effect may play a role in cloud development over arid and semi-arid areas of East Asia and contribute to the reduction of precipitation.

The dust load is much lower during winter and autumn (lower AOD and higher a values compared to the other seasons). The interannual variation of AOD and a suggests that the dust load exhibits large decreasing trends (AOD slopes down to-0.22, a slopes up to 0.47 decade-1) over the Thar desert and large increasing trends between the Aral and Caspian seas (AOD and a slopes up to 0.23 decade-1 and down to-0.61 decade-1, respectively.) The AOD data are evaluated against AERONET surface-based measurements. Generally, MODIS and AERONET data are in good agreement with a correlation coefficient (R) equal to 0.835.},

abstract = {The desiccation of the Aral Sea ranks among the largest man-made ecological catastrophes and has become a global symbol for the overexploitation of limited resources and the environmental and socio-economic consequences caused thereby. Formerly the fourth largest inland lake, large parts of the Aral Sea have been transformed into a salty desert – the Aralkum. The exposed lake bed sediments are subject to wind erosion, resulting in white sand and dust storms which have been tracked over several hundred kilometres using remote sensing images. Dust deposition data, on the other hand, requires excessive field work over prolonged periods of time and thus is scarce. But this kind of ground-based monitoring provides valuable insights into the physical and chemical composition of the transported material. The dust transported from the Aralkum contains, among other things, salts, heavy metals and agrochemicals deposited in the Aral Sea over decades. It can contribute to soil salinization, damage crops and technical infrastructure and impair the human health in the region surrounding the Aralkum, making the analysis of the aeolian dust deposition highly relevant. In the study presented here passive dust deposition data from 23 meteorological stations in the Turan lowland have been collected between 2003 and 2012 and analyzed for their grain size, mineralogical, and chemical characterization in order to identify the influence the newly formed Aralkum has on the Central Asian dust dynamic.},

The average values of AOD at 500 nm, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (in the range 340-870 nm) are found to be 0.78 ± 0.32, 0.78 ± 0.28, and 0.45 ± 0.21, respectively, for the entire period of observations. The AOD data show significant curvature in the ln$\tau$ versus ln$\lambda$ relationship suggesting different dominant aerosol types depending on season. In order to analyze further the curvature effect and the relative dominance of aerosol size, $\alpha$ has been calculated in three wavelength bands, i.e., shorter (0.34-0.50 $\mu$m), longer (0.675-0.87 $\mu$m), and broad (0.34-0.87 $\mu$m) during four seasons, summer (April-June), monsoon (July-September), winter (October-January), and spring (February-March) accompanied with calculations of $\alpha$′, which quantifies the deviation of logarithmic behavior of AOD with ln$\lambda$. The $\alpha$′ values are found to be positive and higher in the months of October-December and mostly negative in February and March, while close to zero values of $\alpha$′ are found in April-August. These results indicate that winter season exhibits dominance of fine-mode aerosols while summer relatively higher concentration of coarse-mode particles. On the other hand, monsoon and spring seasons revealed the presence of mixed type, both fine- and coarse-mode aerosols over Delhi.

Lidar measurements were supplemented with surface-based measurements of PM 2.5 and PM 10 mass and chemical composition in both size fractions. Dust transported into the region is common, being detected 33{\%} of the time. The maximum frequency occurred in the spring of 2009. Dust transported to Central Asia comes from regional sources, for example, Taklimakan desert and Aral Sea basin, and from long-range transport, for example, deserts of Arabia, Northeast Africa, Iran, and Pakistan. Regional sources are characterized by pollution transport with maximum values of coarse particles within the planetary boundary layer, aerosol optical thickness, extinction coefficient, integral coefficient of aerosol backscatter, and minimum values of the {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent. Pollution associated with air masses transported over long distances has different characteristics during autumn, winter, and spring. During winter, dust emissions were low resulting in high values of the {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent (about 0.51) and the fine particle mass fraction (64{\%}). Dust storms were more frequent during spring with an increase in coarse dust particles in comparison to winter. The aerosol vertical profiles can be used to lower uncertainty in estimating radiative forcing. },

abstract = {Sign and magnitude of solar aerosol direct radiative forcing are largely determined by the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) and the albedo of the underlying scene (e.g., surface albedo). On a global scale, mineral dust aerosol has the largest mass emission rate, average column mass burden, and average optical depth of all aerosol types. Therefore, better understanding of its optical properties with a focus on SSA is of great importance. Here, we entrain ten bulk soil samples from deserts and semi-arid regions in the Arabian Peninsula, from locations representative of the Sahara and Sahel in North Africa, and from Northeast Africa and South-Central Asia. We segregate the fine particle fraction (aerodynamic diameter{\textless}2.5 m) and measure its iron content with an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer and its aerosol SSA and absorption, scattering, and extinction ngstrm coefficients for two wavelengths (405 nm and 870 nm) with a photoacoustic instrument with integrating reciprocal nephelometer. Results show that SSA is much lower at 405 nm than at 870 nm and that SSA at both wavelengths is dominated by and linearly correlated with the iron content of the entrained mineral dust. The second result points toward potential use of SSA remote sensing to measure aerosol iron content and vice versa, measurements of iron content with simple filter sampling followed by XRF analysis, providing an assessment of SSA for aerosol radiative forcing calculations and modeling. Average ngstrm coefficients were ≈3.2 for absorption, ≈-0.4 for scattering, and ≈-0.3 for extinction and showed little correlation with iron content. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {The Central Asian deserts are a major dust source region that can potentially have a substantial impact on the Caspian Sea. Despite major advances in the modeling and prediction of the Caspian Sea Level (CSL) during recent years, no study to date has investigated the climatic effects of dust on the hydrological budget of the Sea. In this study, we utilize a regional climate model coupled to an interactive emission and transport scheme to simulate the effects of dust and other aerosol in the Caspian region. First, we present a validation of the model using a variety of AOD satellite observations as well as a climatology of dust storms. Compared to the range of satellite estimates, the model's AOD climatology is closer to the lower end of the observations, and exhibit a significant underestimation over the clay deserts found on the Ustyurt plateau and north of the Aral Sea. Nevertheless, we find encouraging results in that the model is able to reproduce the gradient of increasing AOD intensity from the middle to the southern part of the Sea. Spatially, the model reproduces reasonably well the observed climatological dust storm frequency maps which show that the most intense dust source regions to be found in the Karakum desert in Turkmenistan and Kyzylkum desert in Uzbekistan east of the Aral Sea. In the second part of this study we explore some impacts of dust and other aerosol on the climatology of the region and on the energy budget of the Sea. We find that the overall direct radiative effects of dust and other aerosol reduce the amount of shortwave radiation reaching the surface, dampen boundary layer turbulence and inhibit convection over the region. We also show that by including dust and aerosol in our simulation, we are able to reduce the positive biases in sea surface temperatures by 1–2 °C. Evaporation is also considerably reduced, resulting in an average difference of approximately {\$}{\$}10{\~{}}$\backslash$hbox {\{}mm{\}}{\~{}}$\backslash$hbox {\{}year{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}10mmyear-1 in the Sea's hydrological budget which is substantial. These findings prove that an accurate projection of climate-induced changes to the CSL must include the effects of dust and other aerosol.},

abstract = {Aerosol interaction with clouds is the main uncertainty for the quantification of the anthropogenic forcing on climate. The first step of the so-called "aerosol indirect effect" is the change of cloud droplet size distribution when seeded by anthropogenic aerosols. Satellite data provide the density and diversity of observations needed for a statistical estimate of this effect. Numerous such studies have demonstrated the correlation between aerosol load and Cloud Droplet Radius (CDR) and a few have quantified the impact of aerosol on the microphysics. Here, we go one step further by using the profiles from the spaceborne CALIPSO lidar that indicates the respective position of aerosol and cloud layers. The results show that, when aerosol and cloud layers are clearly separated, there is no correlation between aerosol load and CDR. On the other hand, when the lidar profile indicates mixing, there is a strong correlation. We focus on the stratocumulus cloud fields off the coast of Namibia and Angola that are seeded by biomass burning aerosols from Africa. The log-log slope of CDR and a proxy of the condensation nuclei number are-0.24 in excellent agreement with theoretical estimate.

abstract = {Abstract A detailed multiple-scattering model has been employed to investigate the sensitivity of radiation profiles and flux divergences to changes in macrostructure and microstructure of basic water cloud types. The study has been performed on a range of cloud types including variable distributions of liquid water content (LWC) and drop-size distributions. Total shortwave heating rates vary from 1 to 5°C h−1 and are larger in higher clouds. IR cooling rates in the upper regions of cloud also increase with increasing elevation and are dominated by the atmospheric window contribution. Thus the typical instrument discriminating the IR radiation between 7 and 14,$\mu$m will measure almost the entire IR radiative cooling or heating of low-level water clouds. Both shortwave heating and IR cooling within cloud layers are primarily dependent on LWC and its vertical distribution and are more or less independent of drop-size distribution. Cloud albedo does vary with drop-size distribution but is virtually independent...},

abstract = {This document updates the 1996 MOD04 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD-96), describing the algorithms for simultaneous remote sensing of aerosol properties over land and ocean from spectral reflectance observed by EOS-MODIS (both Terra and Aqua). The Collection 5 (C005) algorithm retrieves the aerosol optical depth (AOD-proportional to the aerosol total loading in the vertical column) and proxies for the size distribution (such as Fine-Weighting (FW)) of the ambient (undisturbed) aerosol, over most of the globe (oceans and the moist parts of the continents) on a daily basis. These aerosol products are primarily intended for radiative budget and climate applications, but are expected to be relevant for hydrological, oceanographic and air quality applications. The combined ocean/land algorithm takes advantage of the MODIS wide spectral range and high spatial resolution with daily global coverage (e.g., 500 m at 0.47 to 2.12 $\mu$m with 250 m at 0.66 and 0.86 $\mu$m and 1 km at 1.38 $\mu$m). These unique MODIS characteristics allow excellent cloud rejection while maintaining high statistics of cloud free pixels. The wide spectral range permits resolution of aerosol size distribution. The land algorithm described here is a complete overhaul from that described in the ATBD-96. The C005 over-land algorithm continues to derive only over sufficiently dark surfaces, but has new surface reflectance parameterizations, aerosol optical models, and assumptions relating to how the 2.12 $\mu$m channel relates to surface and surface properties. The C005 ocean algorithm is generally described by the ATBD-96, but we add here a chapter describing the changes to it. Co-located sunphotometer validation is provided for both land and ocean products. The gas (ozone, water vapor and carbon dioxide) absorption corrections to the reflectance are described here. Finally, we include a section describing the structure of the operational product files (i.e. MOD04/MYD04-C005).},

abstract = {The aeolian transport of dust, sand and salt is a common process in southern Kazakhstan, as well as in the Aral Sea region. Anthropogenic desertification and the desiccation of the Aral Sea have occurred in the basin since 1960. The whole area of the desiccated seafloor is now a new salt desert, and it became an active source of dust, sand or salt storms. The newly formed Aralkum desert was found to be the dominant source of aeolian sand, dust and salt aerosols. Additionally, the most frequent storms were observed in Pre-Aral Karakum and Kyzylkum deserts, where these storms occurred from 40 to 110 days average per year. Aeolian sands and dusts flowed mainly from eastern and north-eastern to the western and south-western directions. The highest amount of sand transportation was observed at the Aral Sea meteorological station. The lowest amount was at the Kazaly meteorological station. Furthermore, transported sand mass has increased at this station during last decade. Most meteorological stations found three maximums of sand and dust transportation, namely in 1966–1970, 1984–1986, and 2000–2002, that is, three periods, like a cycle about every 15 years. Overall, most of the meteorological stations showed the slight decrease in sand and dust transportation that may be explained by fixing sand control measures and other activities which have been done against deflation processes in the region.},

Errors and agreement between satellite and ground data were reported using Pearson's correlation (R) and relative mean bias (RMB). Results showed that the DT3K C6.1 highest quality flag (QF = 3) AOD retrievals were well correlated with the sunphotometer AOD data, with an R of 0.82 and an RMB of 1.01. Overestimation and underestimation in DT AOD retrievals were observed for AOD {\textgreater} 1.1 and AOD {\textless} 1.1, respectively. A significant underestimation of 37{\%} in DB10K AOD retrievals was observed across all the sites except ZZ, which was indicated by a low-value RMB (0.63). Spatial distribution maps showed high AOD values ({\textgreater} 0.8) over the lower part of the YERB and low AOD values ({\textless}0.4) across the upstream part of the YERB. This might be due to a large number of aerosol emissions over the lower developed areas and a scarcity of aerosols over the upstream mountain areas.

One-month experiment results of April 2006 reveal that the data assimilation can correct the much overestimated aerosol surface mass concentration, and has a strong positive effect on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulation, improving agreement with observations. Improvement is limited with the {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m Exponent (AE) simulation, except for much improved correlation coefficient and model skill scores over the Ansai site. Better agreement of the AOD spatial distribution with the independent observations of Terra (Deep Blue) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) AODs is obtained by assimilating the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD product, especially for regions with AODs lower than 0.30. This study confirms the usefulness of the remote sensing observations for the improvement of global aerosol modeling.},

abstract = {During the ACE-Asia field campaign, unprecedented amounts of aerosol property data in East Asia during springtime were collected from an array of aircraft, shipboard, and surface instruments. However, most of the observations were obtained in areas downwind of the source regions. In this paper, the newly developed satellite aerosol algorithm called "Deep Blue" was employed to characterize the properties of aerosols over source regions using radiance measurements from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Based upon the Angstrom exponent derived from the Deep Blue algorithm, it was demonstrated that this new algorithm is able to distinguish dust plumes from fine-mode pollution particles even in complex aerosol environments such as the one over Beijing. Furthermore, these results were validated by comparing them with observations from AERONET sites in China and Mongolia during spring 2001. These comparisons show that the values of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical thickness from Deep Blue are generally within 20{\%}-30{\%} of those measured by sunphotometers. The analyses also indicate that the roles of mineral dust and anthropogenic particles are comparable in contributing to the overall aerosol distributions during spring in northern China, while fine-mode particles are dominant over southern China. The spring season in East Asia consists of one of the most complex environments in terms of frequent cloudiness and wide ranges of aerosol loadings and types. This paper will discuss how the factors contributing to this complexity influence the resulting aerosol monthly averages from various satellite sensors and, thus, the synergy among satellite aerosol products.},

abstract = {Relationships between precipitation rate and aerosol optical depth, the extinction of light by aerosol in an atmospheric column, have been observed in satellite-retrieved data. What are the reasons for these precipitation-aerosol relationships? We investigate relationships between convective precipitation rate (Rconv) and aerosol optical depth ($\tau$tot) using the ECHAM5-HAM aerosol-climate model. We show that negative R conv-$\tau$tot relationships arise due to wet scavenging of aerosol. The apparent lack of negative Rconv-$\tau$tot relationships in satellite-retrieved data is likely because the satellite data do not sample wet scavenging events. When convective wet scavenging is excluded in the model, we find positive Rconv-$\tau$tot relationships in regions where convective precipitation is the dominant form of model precipitation. The spatial distribution of these relationships is in good agreement with satellite-based results. We further demonstrate that a substantial component of these positive relationships arises due to covariation with large-scale relative humidity. Although the interpretation of precipitation-aerosol relationships remains a challenging question, we suggest that progress can be made through a synergy between observations and models. Key Points Negative precipitation-aerosol relationships arise due to wet scavenging Satellites poorly sample aerosol populations depleted by wet scavenging Positive precipitation-aerosol relationships arise due to humidification effects {\textcopyright} 2014.

All cloud optical properties were analyzed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 12 years from 2001 to 2013. We also monitored origin and movements of air masses that bring aerosol particles and may be considered as the natural source of aerosol particles in the region. For this purpose, the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to make trajectories of these air masses from their sources. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) high values were observed in summer during the monsoon period (June-August). The highest AOD values in July were recorded ranges from 0.41 to 1.46. In addition, low AOD values were found in winter season (December-February) particularly in December, ranges from 0.16 to 0.69. We then analyzed the relationship between AOD and {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent that is a good indicator of the size of an aerosol particle. We further described the relationships of AOD and four cloud parameters, namely water vapor (WV), cloud fraction (CF), cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud top pressure (CTP) by producing regional correlation maps of their data values. The analyses showed negative correlation between AOD and {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent especially in central and western Sindh. The correlation between AOD and WV was throughout positive with high correlation values {\textgreater} 0.74 in whole Sindh except eastern most arid strip of the Thar Desert in the region. The correlation between AOD and CF was positive in southern Sindh and goes to negative in northern Sindh. AOD showed a positive correlation with CTP and CTT in northern Sindh and a negative correlation in southern Sindh. All these correlations were observed to be dependent on the meteorological conditions for all of the ten sites investigated.},

abstract = {The aerosol products retrieved using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 5.1 Deep Blue algorithm have provided useful information about aerosol properties over bright-reflecting land surfaces, such as desert, semiarid, and urban regions. However, many components of the C5.1 retrieval algorithm needed to be improved; for example, the use of a static surface database to estimate surface reflectances. This is particularly important over regions of mixed vegetated and nonvegetated surfaces, which may undergo strong seasonal changes in land cover. In order to address this issue, we develop a hybrid approach, which takes advantage of the combination of precalculated surface reflectance database and normalized difference vegetation index in determining the surface reflectance for aerosol retrievals. As a result, the spatial coverage of aerosol data generated by the enhanced Deep Blue algorithm has been extended from the arid and semiarid regions to the entire land areas. In this paper, the changes made in the enhanced Deep Blue algorithm regarding the surface reflectance estimation, aerosol model selection, and cloud screening schemes for producing the MODIS collection 6 aerosol products are discussed. A similar approach has also been applied to the algorithm that generates the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Deep Blue products. Based upon our preliminary results of comparing the enhanced Deep Blue aerosol products with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements, the expected error of the Deep Blue aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is estimated to be better than 0.05 + 20{\%}. Using 10 AERONET sites with long-term time series, 79{\%} of the best quality Deep Blue AOT values are found to fall within this expected error. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {This study is aimed at a better understanding of how upstream runoffformation affected the cropping intensity (CI: Number of harvests) in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) between 2000 and 2012. MODIS 250 m NDVI time series and knowledge-based pixel masking that included settlement layers and topography features enabled to map the irrigated cropland extent (iCE). Random forest models supported the classification of cropland vegetation phenology (CVP: Winter/summer crops, double cropping, etc.). CI and the percentage of fallow cropland (PF) were derived from CVP. Spearman's rho was selected for assessing the statistical relation of CI and PF to runoffformation in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya catchments per hydrological year. Validation in 12 reference sites using multi-annual Landsat-7 ETM+ images revealed an average overall accuracy of 0.85 for the iCE maps. MODIS maps overestimated that based on Landsat by an average factor of {\~{}}1.15 (MODIS iCE/Landsat iCE). Exceptional overestimations occurred in case of inaccurate settlement layers. The CVP and CI maps achieved overall accuracies of 0.91 and 0.96, respectively. The Amu Darya catchment disclosed significant positive (negative) relations between upstream runoffwith CI (PF) and a high pressure on the river water resources in 2000-2012. Along the Syr Darya, reduced dependencies could be observed, which is potentially linked to the high number of water constructions in that catchment. Intensified double cropping after drought years occurred in Uzbekistan. However, a 10 km × 10 km grid of Spearman's rho (CI and PF vs. upstream runoff) emphasized locations at different CI levels that are directly affected by runofffluctuations in both river systems. The resulting maps may thus be supportive on the way to achieve long-term sustainability of crop production and to simultaneously protect the severely threatened environment in the ASB. The gained knowledge can be further used for investigating climatic impacts of irrigation in the region.},

abstract = {The effect of desert dust on cloud properties and precipitation has so far been studied solely by using theoretical models, which predict that rainfall would be enhanced. Here we present observations showing the contrary; the effect of dust on cloud properties is to inhibit precipitation. Using satellite and aircraft observations we show that clouds forming within desert dust contain small droplets and produce little precipitation by drop coalescence. Measurement of the size distribution and the chemical analysis of individual Saharan dust particles collected in such a dust storm suggest a possible mechanism for the diminished rainfall. The detrimental impact of dust on rainfall is smaller than that caused by smoke from biomass burning or anthropogenic air pollution, but the large abundance of desert dust in the atmosphere renders it important. The reduction of precipitation from clouds affected by desert dust can cause drier soil, which in turn raises more dust, thus providing a possible feedback loop to further decrease precipitation. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes of land use exposing the topsoil can initiate such a desertification feedback process.},

Mineral dusts in the atmosphere and their interactions with clouds and precipitation have great impacts on regional climate in Asia, where there are large arid and semiarid regions. In this review paper, we summarize the typical transport paths of East Asian dust, which affect regional and global climates, and discuss numerous effects of dust aerosols on clouds and precipitation primarily over East Asian arid and semiarid regions. We hope to provide a benchmark of our present understanding of these issues. Compared with the aerosols of Saharan dust, those of East Asian dust are more absorptive of solar radiation, and its direct radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere is nearly positive or nil. It means that aerosols of East Asian dust can influence the cloud properties not only by acting as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei (via first indirect effect, second indirect effect, and invigoration effect) but also through changing the relative humidity and stability of the atmosphere (via semidirect effect). Converting visible light to thermal energy, dust aerosols can burn clouds to produce a warming effect on climate, which is opposite to the first and second indirect effects of aerosols. The net dust aerosol radiative effects are still highly unclear. In addition, dust can inhibit or enhance precipitation under certain conditions, thus impacting the hydrological cycle. Over Asian arid and semiarid regions, the positive feedback loop in the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction may aggravate drought in its inner land.},

abstract = {Isomerization-cracking of long paraffins to produce octane enhancers for the gasoline pool is a complex refinery operation that needs simultaneous adjustment of the molecular size of the feed (cracking) and skeletal branching (isomerization). As both reactions are acid-catalyzed it is very difficult to adjust the acidity distribution of a single catalyst to have a proper balance. In this work the used catalyst is a mixture of an isomerization catalyst (Pt/WO 3-ZrO 2) (PtWZ) and a cracking catalyst (Pt/SO 4 2--ZrO 2) (PtSZ), working at the same reaction conditions. The tests were performed using n-hexadecane as a model feedstock. The screening of pressure and temperature conditions indicates that the best match for both catalysts is 20 atm and 225 ??C. Stable activity levels for both catalysts can only be achieved at a H 2/n-C 16 ratio of 10. An adequate space velocity for increasing the yield to iC 5-9 and preventing consecutive cracking is 18.4 h - 1. At this process conditions mixtures (PtWZ + PtSZ) that contain 25{\%} or 50{\%} PtSZ have a better product distribution, with the maximum displaced to higher carbon numbers, with a reduced yield to isobutane and light gasses. Operation points lie on a monotonic curve of octane number gain (??RON) as a function of the yield of light gasses (C 1-4) that indicates that RON gains can only be obtained at the expense of the liquid yield. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) has been providing high-quality retrievals of aerosol optical properties from the surface at worldwide locations for more than a decade. Many sites have continuous and consistent records for more than 10 years, which enables the investigation of long-term trends in aerosol properties at these locations. In this study, we present the results of a trend analysis at selected stations with long data records. In addition to commonly studied parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent (AE), we also focus on inversion products including absorption aerosol optical depth (ABS), single-scattering albedo (SSA) and the absorption {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent (AAE). Level 2.0 quality assured data are the primary source. However, due to the scarcity of level 2.0 inversion products resulting from the strict AOD quality control threshold, we have also analyzed level 1.5 data, with some quality control screening to provide a reference for global results. Two statistical methods are used to detect and estimate the trend: the Mann-Kendall test associated with Sen's slope and linear least-squares fitting. The results of these statistical tests agree well in terms of the significance of the trend for the majority of the cases. The results indicate that Europe and North America experienced a uniform decrease in AOD, while significant ({\textgreater}90{\%}) increases in these two parameters are found for North India and the Arabian Peninsula. The AE trends turn out to be different for North America and Europe, with increases for the former and decreases for the latter, suggesting opposite changes in fine/coarse-mode fraction. For level 2.0 inversion parameters, Beijing and Kanpur both experienced an increase in SSA. Beijing also shows a reduction in ABS, while the SSA increase for Kanpur is mainly due the increase in scattering aerosols. Increased absorption and reduced SSA are found at Solar-Village. At level 1.5, most European and North American sites also show positive SSA and negative ABS trends, although the data are more uncertain. The AAE trends are less spatially coherent due to large uncertainties, except for a robust increase at three sites in West Africa, which suggests a possible reduction in black carbon. Overall, the trends do not exhibit obvious seasonality for the majority of parameters and stations.},

abstract = {The drastic desiccation of the Aral Sea has led to severe desertification of the former lake areas. Dust storms occur frequently, causing regional environmental degradation of the Aral basin and a serious ecological disaster. Knowledge of the temporal variability in dust emissions and the potential diffusion characteristics of dust aerosol originating from the Aral Sea basin in recent years are, however, lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the interannual and intraannual changes in dust aerosol from the Aral Sea basin and its potentially seasonal diffusion characteristics from 2005 to 2013 using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol data (2005-2013) and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Results show that the OMI aerosol index (AI) annual mean, standard deviation, median, and maximum values exhibit a strong increasing trend because of the continuous decrease in the water level since 2005. The annually mean OMI AI increases to 1.47 by 2013. Peak AI values are recorded in spring (March-May) and early winter (November-January of the following year), indicating notifying seasonal differences. The potential distance and height of air parcel trajectories to the northeast are greater than those to the west and south, whereas the air parcel trajectory proportion of the former is lower than that of the latter. The potential transport distance of dust aerosol to the northeast is greatest in spring and winter. This transport distance is less in autumn, with the minimum observed in summer. Dust transport distance to the west and south in different seasons is not significantly different. The present results may help in further understanding the emission, long-range transport, and deposition of dust from the dry lake bed of the Aral Sea as well as providing a motivation for the sensible use and protection of these tail-end lakes.},

abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of five instruments aboard the Terra Earth Observing System (EOS) platform launched in December 1999. After achieving final orbit, MODIS began earth observations in late February 2000 and has been acquiring data since that time. The instrument is also being flown on the Aqua spacecraft, launched in May 2002. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for cloud detection and the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties have been developed by members of the MODIS atmosphere science team. The archived products from these algorithms have applications in climate change studies, climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, as well as fundamental atmospheric research. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. We will describe the various algorithms being used for the remote sensing of cloud properties from MODIS data with an emphasis on the pixel-level retrievals (referred to as Level-2 products), with 1-km or 5-km spatial resolution at nadir. An example of each Level-2 cloud product from a common data granule (5 min of data) off the coast of South America will be discussed. Future efforts will also be mentioned. Relevant points related to the global gridded statistics products (Level-3) are highlighted though additional details are given in an accompanying paper in this issue. {\textcopyright} 2003 IEEE.},

The cloud parameters are improved primarily through 1) improved knowledge of the spectral response functions for the MODIS 15-$\mu$m carbon dioxide bands gleaned from comparison of coincident MODIS and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) radiance measurements and 2) continual comparison of global MODIS and Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) instantaneous cloud products throughout the course of algorithm refinement.

abstract = {There have been numerous recent publications showing that mineral dust might be a good absorber for solar radiation in addition to its capability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice forming nuclei (IFN), and could lead to reduced cloud cover and precipitation in the region where it is present. This effect is investigated using a dynamic cloud model with detailed microphysics of both warm and ice phase processes. The model is initialized using measured size distributions and concentrations of mineral dust particles. Our results show that when dust appears at the cloud-base height and below 3 km, where the temperature is warmer than −5°C, the heating induced by the presence of dust layers can inhibit the formation of cloud droplets and suppresses the development of precipitation, leading to lower cloud optical depth and albedo. On the other hand, when the dust layers are located at altitudes with temperature colder than −5°C, or above the −5°C level, mineral aerosols can act as effective ice nuclei, intensify the ice-forming processes, and may enhance the development of cloud and precipitation. It is also found that the heating effect is more pronounced in continental clouds than in maritime clouds.},

abstract = {The Central Asian Arid Zone (CAAZ) located in the temperate desert belt of the Northern Hemisphere is one of the most important sources for global aeolian dust and aerosol. It is widely acknowledged that aeolian dust plays a vital role in the Earth system through participating in the energy and material budget of the planet. Except for the existed natural desert areas, the newly human-induced deserts that originally used to be the bed of terminal lakes (like the Aral Sea, Caspian Sea, Balkhash Lake, etc.) are becoming the much more significant sources for aeolian dust/salt in this region. Dust and associated aerosols have complex impacts on local ecological system and human health for its special chemical composition. In recent years, a slight declining trend of dust storm frequency in the region was reported, which may be explained by the weakened human disturbances in desert areas or climate variations. The dust dynamics in the CAAZ represent considerable variations in both spatial and temporal distribution, which makes it harder to forecast the dust events and mitigate its damages to ecosystems and social economics. Nevertheless, there is not much evidence of its climatic and environmental impacts both on the regional and global scales. Therefore, further related studies and regulation measures in the region are essential and emergent, as well as the strengthening cooperation between the associated countries and organizations.},

abstract = {In the present study, we examined the spatial and temporal variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and its relationship with various cloud parameters derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard Terra satellite. The data have been analyzed for the period of 10-years between March 2003 and February 2013 over 12 major cities in China. The results revealed that high AOD noticed over low latitude regions influenced with high anthropogenic activities and the low AOD observed for the high altitude and mountainous areas, since AOD accounts for the slant path which reduces the aerosol emissions. In addition, the aerosol variations in the atmosphere are complicated by several factors in emissions (natural and anthropogenic) as well as stagnant synoptic meteorology. From the temporal studies, it is clear that the maximum AOD was found during summer followed by spring and autumn with a minimum AOD in winter season for all the regions of study in China. Furthermore, we studied the relationship between AOD versus water vapor (WV), cloud fraction (CF), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER), cloud top pressure (CTP), and cloud top temperature (CTT) for the selected regions in China. Additionally, regression analysis and one paired student's t-Test were applied to represent the probability of data significant at 95{\%} confidence for the derived AOD values and cloud parameters in order to provide a better understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction.},

abstract = {Retrieving aerosol properties from satellite remote sensing over a bright surface is a challenging problem in the research of atmospheric and land applications. In this paper we propose a new approach to retrieve aerosol properties over surfaces such as arid, semiarid, and urban areas, where the surface reflectance is usually very bright in the red part of visible spectrum and in the near infrared, but is much darker in the blue spectral region (i.e., wavelength {\textless}500 nm). In order to infer atmospheric properties from these data, a global surface reflectance database of 0.1° latitude by 0.1° longitude resolution was constructed over bright surfaces for visible wavelengths using the minimum reflectivity technique (e.g., finding the clearest scene during each season for a given location). The aerosol optical thickness and aerosol type are then determined simultaneously in the algorithm using lookup tables to match the satellite observed spectral radiances. Examples of aerosol optical thickness derived using this algorithm over the Sahara Desert and Arabian Peninsula reveal various dust sources, which are important contributors to airborne dust transported over long distances. Comparisons of the satellite inferred aerosol optical thickness and the values from ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun/sky radiometer measurements indicate good agreement (i.e., within 30{\%}) over the sites in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. This new algorithm, when applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS), and Global Imager (GLI) satellite data, will provide high spatial resolution (∼1 km) global information of aerosol optical thickness over bright surfaces on a daily basis.},

abstract = {The same prescribed anthropogenic aerosol forcing was implemented into three climate models. The atmosphere components of these participating climate models were the GAMIL, ECHAM, and CAM models. Ensemble simulations were carried out to obtain a reliable estimate of anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF). The ensemble mean ERFs from these three participating models with this aerosol forcing were {\&}minus;0.27, {\&}minus;0.63, and {\&}minus;0.54 W∙m{\&}minus;2. The model diversity in ERF is clearly reduced as compared with those based on the models{\&}rsquo; own default approaches ({\&}minus;1.98, {\&}minus;0.21, and {\&}minus;2.22 W∙m{\&}minus;2). This is consistent with the design of this aerosol forcing. The modeled ERF can be decomposed into two basic components, i.e., the instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) from aerosol{\&}ndash;radiation interactions (RFari) and the aerosol-induced changes in cloud forcing (△Fcloud*). For the three participating models, the model diversity in RFari ({\&}minus;0.21, {\&}minus;0.33, and {\&}minus;0.29 W∙m{\&}minus;2) could be constrained by reducing the differences in natural aerosol radiative forcings. However, it was difficult to figure out the reason for the model diversity in △Fcloud* ({\&}minus;0.05, {\&}minus;0.28, and {\&}minus;0.24 W∙m{\&}minus;2), which was the dominant source of the model diversity in ERF. The variability of modeled ERF was also studied. Ensemble simulations showed that the modeled RFs were very stable. The rapid adjustments (ERF {\&}minus; RF) had an important role to play in the quantification of the perturbation of ERF. Fortunately, the contribution from the rapid adjustments to the mean ERF was very small. This study also showed that we should pay attention to the difference between the aerosol climate effects we want and the aerosol climate effects we calculate.},

abstract = {Cloud drop condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) particles determine to a large extent cloud microstructure and, consequently, cloud albedo and the dynamic response of clouds to aerosol-induced changes to precipitation. This can modify the reflected solar radiation and the thermal radiation emitted to space. Measurements of tropospheric CCN and IN over large areas have not been possible and can be only roughly approximated from satellite-sensor-based estimates of optical properties of aerosols. Our lack of ability to measure both CCN and cloud updrafts precludes disentangling the effects ofmeteorology fromthose of aerosols and represents the largest component in our uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing.Ways to improve the retrieval accuracy include multiangle and multipolarimetric passive measurements of the optical signal and multispectral lidar polarimetric measurements. Indirect methods include proxies of trace gases, as retrieved by hyperspectral sensors. Perhaps the most promising emerging direction is retrieving the CCN properties by simultaneously retrieving convective cloud drop number concentrations and updraft speeds, which amounts to using clouds as natural CCN chambers. These satellite observations have to be constrained by in situ observations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation-climate (ACPC) interactions, which in turn constrain a hierarchy of model simulations of ACPC. Since the essence of a general circulation model is an accurate quantifi cation of the energy and mass fluxes in all forms between the surface, atmosphere and outer space, a route to progress is proposed here in the form of a series of box flux closure experiments in the various climate regimes. A roadmap is provided for quantifying the ACPC interactions and thereby reducing the uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the global dust cycle is limited by a dearth of information about dust sources, especially small-scale features which could account for a large fraction of global emissions. Here we present a global-scale high-resolution (0.1) mapping of sources based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue estimates of dust optical depth in conjunction with other data sets including land use. We ascribe dust sources to natural and anthropogenic (primarily agricultural) origins, calculate their respective contributions to emissions, and extensively compare these products against literature. Natural dust sources globally account for 75{\%} of emissions; anthropogenic sources account for 25{\%}. North Africa accounts for 55{\%} of global dust emissions with only 8{\%} being anthropogenic, mostly from the Sahel. Elsewhere, anthropogenic dust emissions can be much higher (75{\%} in Australia). Hydrologic dust sources (e.g., ephemeral water bodies) account for 31{\%} worldwide; 15{\%} of them are natural while 85{\%} are anthropogenic. Globally, 20{\%} of emissions are from vegetated surfaces, primarily desert shrublands and agricultural lands. Since anthropogenic dust sources are associated with land use and ephemeral water bodies, both in turn linked to the hydrological cycle, their emissions are affected by climate variability. Such changes in dust emissions can impact climate, air quality, and human health. Improved dust emission estimates will require a better mapping of threshold wind velocities, vegetation dynamics, and surface conditions (soil moisture and land use) especially in the sensitive regions identified here, as well as improved ability to address small-scale convective processes producing dust via cold pool (haboob) events frequent in monsoon regimes. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {The aerosol optical depth has in several recent studies been found to correlate with cloud fraction. This study examines the global distribution of the total correlation between aerosol optical depth, cloud fraction and meteorological conditions using satellite observations together with atmospheric re-analysis data from the ECMWF. The results show large regional differences in the correlation between aerosol optical depth and cloud fraction, where a higher correlation is found over remote ocean. The one meteorological variable that correlates significantly with both aerosol optical depth and cloud fraction is the 10-meter wind speed. Constructing the partial correlation between aerosol optical depth and cloud fraction, with the impact from 10-meter wind speed removed, yields a significant difference compared to the total correlation. In several regions the remaining partial correlation is reduced from 0.4 to below 0.1. The results highlight the need to investigate all possible correlations between meteorological variables, cloud properties and aerosols.

Over the past 10 millennia, it has repeatedly filled and dried, owing both to natural and human forces. The most recent desiccation started in the early 1960s and owes overwhelmingly to the expansion of irrigation that has drained its two tributary rivers. Lake level has fallen 23 m, area shrunk 74{\%}, volume decreased 90{\%}, and salinity grew from 10 to more than 100g/l, causing negative ecological changes, including decimation of native fish species, initiation of dust/salt storms, degradation of deltaic biotic communities, and climate change around the former shoreline. The population residing around the lake has also been negatively impacted. There is little hope in the foreseeable future to fully restore the Aral Sea, but measures to preserve/rehabilitate parts of the water body and the deltas are feasible.},

A number of studies have reported correlations between aerosol properties and precipitation data. Despite previous research, it is still hard to quantify the overall effects that aerosols have on precipitation as multiple influencing factors such as relative humidity (RH) can distort the observed relationship between aerosols and precipitation. Thus, in this study, both satellite-retrieved and reanalysis data were used to investigate the relationship between aerosols and precipitation in the Southeast Asia region from 2001 to 2015, with RH considered as a possible influencing factor. Different analyses in the study indicate that a positive correlation was present between Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and precipitation over northern Southeast Asia region during the autumn and the winter seasons, while a negative correlation was identified over the Maritime Continent during the autumn season. Subsequently, a partial correlation analysis revealed that while RH influences the long-term negative correlations between AOD and precipitation, it did not significantly affect the positive correlations seen in the winter season. The result of this study provides additional evidence with respect to the critical role of RH as an influencing factor in AOD-precipitation relationship over Southeast Asia.},

abstract = {The Aral Sea has been shrinking since the former Soviet Union constructed irrigation projects to divert water from its main rivers in the 1960s. The diminishing of the Aral Sea is "one of the worst environmental disasters in the world" (from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon). In this study, 33 years of satellite observations from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and 21 years of satellite altimetry sea level data from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, and Jason-2 are used to quantify the long-term hydrological changes in the Aral Sea. A simple algorithm with AVHRR channels 1 and 2 albedo is developed to identify and discriminate the water pixels from land and cloud. Thus, monthly water coverage in the region can be reliably generated. The water coverage maps since 1981 show constant decline of the Aral Sea. The coverage dropped from ∼4.7-4.8 × 10 4 km 2 in 1981 to about of this value in the recent years. In fact, drastic hydrological change was observed in the main Aral Sea during the 2000s. In the South Aral Sea, sea level shows a steady decrease from 35 m above sea level to {\textless}26 m since 1993. Total loss of water storage since 1993 is estimated to be ∼2.0 × 10 2 km 3 for the South Aral Sea with a rate of ∼16-20 km 3 /yr before 2002, and a smaller value after 2002. In 1990, the North Aral Sea was observed to separate from the main Aral Sea. Water coverage, sea level, and total water storage were kept relatively stable for the period between 1993 and 2013 in the North Aral Sea. A water level increase and coverage expansion occurred during the 2005-2006 period when a dam was built in 2005 between the North Aral Sea and the South-East Aral Sea.

abstract = {The hygroscopic growth of aerosols is controlled by the relative humidity (RH) and changes the aerosols' physical and hence optical properties. Observational studies of aerosol-cloud interactions evaluate the aerosol concentration using optical parameters, such as the aerosol optical depth (AOD), which can be affected by aerosol humidification. In this study we evaluate the RH background and variance values, in the lower cloudy atmosphere, an additional source of variance in AOD values beside the natural changes in aerosol concentration. In addition, we estimate the bias in RH and AOD, related to cloud thickness. This provides the much needed range of RH-related biases in studies of aerosol-cloud interaction. Twelve years of radiosonde measurements (June-August) in thirteen globally distributed stations are analyzed. The estimated non-biased AOD variance due to day-to-day changes in RH is found to be around 20{\%} and the biases linked to cloud development around 10{\%}. Such an effect is important and should be considered in direct and indirect aerosol effect estimations but it is inadequate to account for most of the AOD trend found in observational studies of aerosol-cloud interactions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Collection 6 (C6) reprocessing of the product was completed in May 2014 and March 2015 for MODIS Aqua and Terra, respectively. Here we provide an overview of major C6 optical property algorithm changes relative to the previous Collection 5 (C5) product. Notable C6 optical and microphysical algorithm changes include: 1) new ice cloud optical property models and a more extensive cloud radiative transfer code lookup table (LUT) approach; 2) improvement in the skill of the shortwave-derived cloud thermodynamic phase; 3) separate cloud effective radius retrieval data sets for each spectral combination used in previous collections; 4) separate retrievals for partly cloudy pixels and those associated with cloud edges; 5) failure metrics that provide diagnostic information for pixels having observations that fall outside the LUT solution space; and 6) enhanced pixel-level retrieval uncertainty calculations. The C6 algorithm changes can collectively result in significant changes relative to C5, though the magnitude depends on the data set and the pixel's retrieval location in the cloud parameter space. Example L2 granule and level-3 gridded data set differences between the two collections are shown.

Here, we perform an in-depth study of the relationship between cloud parameters and meteorological factors over the TP. The spatiotemporal variations in cloud cover and cloud optical thickness over the TP during the daytime from 2003 to 2015 are analysed using the Aqua-MODIS level 2 atmospheric product data MYD06. Results show that the annual average cloud cover over the TP decreases from the southeast to the northwest. The cloud cover of the western TP is highest in spring and lowest in autumn, while the cloud cover of the eastern TP is higher in spring and summer. The cloud covers in most areas of the TP exceed 30{\%} in spring and summer, and the cloud optical thickness in the southeastern TP exceeds 10 in summer, with substantial cloud cover and cloud optical thickness changes. Compared to other seasons, the cooling effect of the near surface cloud net radiative forcing is greater during daytime in summer, which is likely associated with thick cloud optical thickness or large cloud cover. The results of the analysis of relationships among cloud cover, water vapour and air temperature show that positive correlations exist between cloud cover and water vapour, and that significantly negative correlations exist between cloud cover and air temperature over the TP. Combined with the analysis of variation features in the cloud parameters and meteorological factors, we find that water vapour variations during the daytime over the TP lead to cloud cover changes, which affect the air temperature variations over the TP by the cooling effects of clouds, especially in summer.},

Uncertainties in the DB AOD were identified and studied, and our results show that the performance of DB c5.1 is strongly dependent on surface albedo and aerosol microphysics. Using data with only "very good" quality assurance, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the DB Terra (Aqua) AOD is 0.24 (0.19) when validated against AERONET. Expanding upon the uncertainty analysis, the potential of applying the DB products for aerosol assimilation was explored. Empirical corrections and quality assurance procedures were developed for North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to create a data assimilation (DA)-quality DB product. After applying those procedures, the RMSE is reduced by 18.1{\%} (18.2{\%}) for Terra (Aqua) DB data. Prognostic error models of 0.069 + 0.175 x AODTerra-DB with no noise floor and 0.048 + 0.182 x AODAqua-DB with a noise floor of 0.104 were found for DA-quality Terra and Aqua DB data, respectively.

abstract = {The twin Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors have been flying on Terra since 2000 and Aqua since 2002, creating an extensive data set of global Earth observations. Here, we introduce the Collection 6 (C6) algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol size parameters from MODIS-observed spectral reflectance. While not a major overhaul from the previous Collection 5 (C5) version, there are enough changes that there are significant impacts to the products and their interpretation. The C6 aerosol data set will be created from three separate retrieval algorithms that operate over different surface types. These are the two "Dark Target" (DT) algorithms for retrieving (1) over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths) and (2) over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible), plus the "Deep Blue" (DB) algorithm developed originally for retrieving (3) over desert/arid land (bright in the visible). Here, we focus on DT-ocean and DT-land ({\#}1 and {\#}2). We have updated assumptions for central wavelengths, Rayleigh optical depths and gas (H2O, O3, CO2, etc.) absorption corrections, while relaxing the solar zenith angle limit (up to {\&}le; 84) to increase poleward coverage. For DT-land, we have updated the cloud mask to allow heavy smoke retrievals, fine-tuned the assignments for aerosol type as function of season/location, corrected bugs in the Quality Assurance (QA) logic, and added diagnostic parameters such topographic altitude. For DT-ocean, improvements include a revised cloud mask for thin-cirrus detection, inclusion of wind speed dependence on the surface reflectance, updates to logic of QA Confidence flag (QAC) assignment, and additions of important diagnostic information. At the same time, we quantified how "upstream" changes to instrument calibration, land/sea masking and cloud masking will also impact the statistics of global AOD, and affect Terra and Aqua differently. For Aqua, all changes will result in reduced global AOD (by 0.02) over ocean and increased AOD (by 0.02) over land, along with changes in spatial coverage. We compared preliminary data to surface-based sun photometer data, and show that C6 should improve upon C5. C6 will include a merged DT/DB product over semi-arid land surfaces for reduced-gap coverage and better visualization, and new information about clouds in the aerosol field. Responding to the needs of the air quality community, in addition to the standard 10 km product, C6 will include a global (DT-land and DT-ocean) aerosol product at 3 km resolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {The aeolian transport of dust is an important process in Central Asia. Anthropogenic desertification and the desiccation of the Aral Sea have increased the overall dust emission and transport from this region and the local dust storm frequency during the last decades. Reliable ground data, however, are collected only sporadically, so the knowledge about the spatial and temporal distribution and dynamics of the dust deposition in the Aral Sea basin is fragmented and inconsistent at best. A long-term monitoring program was installed and sustained by three research projects. The results included in this article cover the dust deposition between 2003 and 2010 from 21 stations in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. They confirm that the aeolian dust transport occurs mainly in the Southern direction. The highest average monthly deposition rate was registered in Uzbekistan (56.2gm-2), while the percentage of months with a very intense (and potentially harmful) dust deposition flux was highest in Turkmenistan (36.4{\%}). A majority of samples were collected during months with a dust deposition of less than 10.0gm-2, while only 6{\%} of all samples showed high monthly deposition intensities of more than 100gm-2. The Kyzyl Kum, Kara Kum, and Aral Kum were identified as the main sources for aeolian dust in the Aral Sea basin. The impact of the Aral Kum as the dominant source of aeolian dust is limited to a region of approximately 500,000km2 surrounding the former Aral Sea. The Kara Kum is characterized by a very high frequency of dust storms of a local and regional magnitude, and close to the Kyzyl Kum, monthly dust deposition rates of up to 9,600gm-2 were registered.An analysis of the temporal distribution of the dust deposition showed a slight increase in the dust deposition activity and intensity between 2003 and 2010, with a strong inter-annual and seasonal dynamic. The highest average dust deposition was registered in June, and a second phase of intense dust deposition was identified in February.As this research covers less than a decade, a continuous monitoring program is strongly advised for a better understanding of the processes of aeolian dust transport and the impact of aeolian dust on arable land and human health. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The human-induced desiccation of the Aral Sea has generated large amounts of salt dust and has been posing a great threat to local ecological environment and human health. Monitoring its land cover changes is essential to obtaining information about the desertification process and dynamics of potential salt/sand dust source. To this end, long-term Landsat imagery was applied for the land use/cover change analysis based on support vector machine approach. The land cover distribution of the study area for 1977, 1987, 1996, 2006 and 2015 was mapped. In addition, the Markov–cellular automata integrated approach was used to predict the land cover change in 2015 and project changes in 2025 by extrapolating current trends. The classification results revealed that water surface of the Aral Sea shrunk by more than 66{\%}, leading to the dramatic expanding of the salt soil and bare area. Change detection analysis indicated a serious land degradation trend as well as a major land cover evolution mode in the Aral Kum that could predict shifts in dust composition. The Markov–cellular automata technique was successful in predicting land cover distribution in 2015, and the projected land cover for 2025 revealed more desertification of the landscape with potential expansion in the salt soils and bare area. It is worth noting that the vegetation cover of the region represented an obvious increase in recent years that may be a good signal of ecological recovery.},

Here we review recent progress towards global and regional constraints on aerosol absorption from observations and modeling, considering physical properties and combined approaches crucial for understanding the total (natural and anthropogenic) influences of aerosols on the climate. Recent Findings: We emphasize developments in black carbon absorption alteration due to coating and ageing, brown carbon characterization, dust composition, absorbing aerosol above cloud, source modeling and size distributions, and validation of high-resolution modeling against a range of observations. Summary: Both observations and modeling of total aerosol absorption, absorbing aerosol optical depths and single scattering albedo, as well as the vertical distribution of atmospheric absorption, still suffer from uncertainties and unknowns significant for climate applications. We offer a roadmap of developments needed to bring the field substantially forward.},

abstract = {The Aral Sea basin (ASB) is one of the most environmentally vulnerable regions to climate change and human activities. During the past 60 years, irrigation has greatly changed the water distribution and caused severe environmental issues in the ASB. Using remote sensing data, this study investigated the environmental changes induced by irrigation activities in this region. The results show that, in the past decade, land water storage has significantly increased in the irrigated upstream regions (13 km3 year-1) but decreased in the downstream regions (-27 km3 year-1) of the Amu Darya River basin, causing a water storage decrease in the whole basin (-20 km3 year-1). As a result, the water surface area of the Aral Sea has decreased from 32,000 in 2000 to 10,000 km2 in 2015. The shrinking Aral Sea exposed a large portion of the lake bottom to the air, increasing (decreasing) the daytime (nighttime) temperatures by about 1 °C year-1 (0.5 °C year-1). Moreover, there were other potential environmental changes, including drier soil, less vegetation, decreasing cloud and precipitation, and more severe and frequent dust storms. Possible biases in the remote sensing data due to the neglect of the shrinking water surface area of the Aral Sea were identified. These findings highlight the severe environmental threats caused by irrigation in Central Asia and call attention to sustainable water use in such dryland regions.},

abstract = {Clouds are important elements in climatic processes and interactions between aerosols and clouds are therefore a hot topic for scientific research. Aerosols show both spatial and temporal variations, which can lead to variations in the microphysics of clouds. In this research, we have examined the spatial and temporal variations in aerosol particles over Pakistan and the impact of these variations on various optical properties of clouds, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra satellite. We used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for trajectory analysis to reveal the origins of air masses, with the aim of understanding these spatial and temporal variabilities in aerosol concentrations. We also documented seasonal variations in patterns of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Pakistan, for which the highest values occur during the monsoon season (June-August). We then analyzed the relationships between AOD and four other cloud parameters, namely water vapour (WV), cloud fraction (CF), cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud top pressure (CTP). Regional correlation maps and time series plots for aerosol (AOD) and cloud parameters were produced to provide a better understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction. The analyses showed strong positive correlations between AOD and WV for all of the eight cities investigated. The correlation between AOD and CF was positive for those cities where the air masses were predominantly humid, but negative for those cities where the air masses were relatively dry and carried a low aerosol abundance. These correlations were clearly dependent on the meteorological conditions for all of the eight cities investigated. Because of the observed AOD-CF relationship, the co-variation of AOD with CTP and CTT may be attributable to large-scale meteorological variations: AOD showed a positive correlation with CTP and CTT in northern regions of Pakistan and a negative correlation in southern regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

All sensors agree very well on the interannual variability of DOD. The seasonal analysis of DOD and dust occurrences identified the largest dust loading and the most frequent dust occurrence in the spring and summer, respectively. No significant trend was found during the research period in terms of both DOD and the dust occurrence. Further analysis of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) aerosol products on a case-by-case basis in most dust months of 2007 suggested that the vertical structure is varying in terms of the extension and the dust loading from one event to another, although dust particles of most episodes have similar physical characteristics (particle shape and size). Our analysis on the vertical structure of dust plumes, the layer-integrated color ratio and depolarization ratio indicates a varied climate effect (e.g., the direct radiative impact) by mineral dust, dependent on the event being observed in Central Asia.},

abstract = {The observed strong link between aerosol optical depth ($\tau$) and cloud top pressure (ptop) has frequently been interpreted as the invigoration of convective clouds by aerosol, with increased $\tau$ being strongly correlated with decreases in ptop (increases in cloud top height). A strong correlation between $\tau$ and cloud fraction (fc) has also been observed. Using satellite-retrieved data, here we show that p top is also strongly correlated to fc, and when combined with the strong sensitivity between fc and $\tau$, a large proportion of the relationship between ptop and $\tau$can be reconstructed. Given the uncertainties about the influence of aerosol-cloud interactions on the $\tau$-fc relationship, this suggests that a large fraction of the $\tau$-ptop correlation may not be due to aerosol effects. Influences such as aerosol humidification and meteorology play an important role and should therefore be considered in studies of aerosol-cloud interactions. {\textcopyright} 2014.

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) was found to be consistently high during spring. Cloud ice radius (CIR) also showed higher values during spring, while an enhancement in cloud water radius (CWR) and fine mode fraction (FMF) was observed during summer. AOD and aerosol index (AI) were found to be higher during January to June. However, FMF and CWR showed enhancement during July to December. Aerosol indirect effect (AIE) in each year has been estimated and found to be showing positive and negative indirect effects. The AIE for fixed cloud ice path (CIP) showed positive indirect effect (Twomey effect) over Yellow sea, while the AIE for fixed cloud water path (CWP) showed a major negative indirect effect (anti-Twomey effect) over all regions. During Changma (summer monsoon) period, the AIE for both CIP and CWP showed dominant anti-Twomey effect in middle and low level clouds, indicating the growth of cloud droplet radius with changes in aerosols, enhancing the precipitation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Woon-Seon Jung et al.},

@article{Yin2002,
abstract = {[1] Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the effect of cloud-processed mineral dust particles on the subsequent development of cloud and precipitation and possible effects on cloud optical properties. A two-dimensional (2-D) nonhydrostatic cloud model with detailed microphysics was used. The initial aerosol spectra used in the 2-D model consisted of both background cloud condensation nuclei and mineral dust particles. These were taken from the results of three successive runs of a parcel model that simulates the interaction of dust and sulfate particles with cloud drops and trace gases and then evaporates the cloud drops. The results show that insoluble mineral dust particles become effective cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) after passing through a convective cloud. Their effectiveness as GCN increases because of a layer of sulfate that is formed on their surface as they are first captured by growing drops or ice crystals and then released as these hydrometeors evaporate. Upon entering subsequent clouds, these particles increase the concentration of the activated drops and widen the drop size distribution. The present work shows that in continental clouds the effect of cloud-processed dust particles is to accelerate the formation of precipitation particles, although the amount of precipitation depends on the concentration of the large and giant CGN. In maritime clouds the addition of cloud-processed aerosol and mineral dust particles has a minimal effect on precipitation because the cloud starts with many large particles already. The addition of more CGN to either maritime or continental clouds increases their optical depth, even for those cases in which the precipitation amount is increased.
