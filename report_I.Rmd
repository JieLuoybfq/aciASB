# Introduction
The desertification of the Aral Sea can be seen as one of the most prominent human 
induced natural disaster of the 21st century [@Ge2016,1; @Groll2019,1; @Shen2019,1; @Micklin2007]. 
With the aim of establishing cotton agriculture in the 1960’s, an overexploitation 
of the sea’s natural resources had begun and lead to an irreversible decrease in 
the water volume and the formation of a new desert in the former lake bed, 
the Aralkum [@Gaybull2012, 1]. This process is summarized under the term of the 
Aral Sea syndrome implying that the irrigation agriculture has not been proven 
to be adjusted to the local ecosystem’s demands. Hence it can be seen nowadays as 
a first-class example of direct human influence in the natural surrounding [@Groll2013, 1f]. 
Coupled with severe environmental impacts comes a variety of ecological, economic 
and social challenges [@Issanova2015, 3213ff]. Added to that, the growth of the 
Aralkum leads to a rising dust storm frequency [@Groll2013, 2]. While mineral 
aerosols play a major role in the composition of these storms, climatological 
mechanisms of much higher complexity can be initiated (ibid.). One of these are 
the aerosol-cloud interactions which may affect local and regional climatology 
as well as the hydrological cycle [@Boucher2013, 573ff.]. As reliable results 
for their environmental effects are still lacking in the Aral Sea region, the 
present study will set out to identify trends in relationships between the aerosol 
composition and cloud microphysics [@Rosenfeld2014, 750ff.].

The investigation of aerosol’s influences on cloud microphysics has become a key 
topic of scientific research [@Alam2010, 1162; @Sharif2015, 657]. There exist 
four major terrestrial sources for atmospheric aerosols: desert dust, biomass 
burning, biogenic and anthropogenic air pollution [@Huang2014, 398]. Based on 
their chemical composition, they either absorb or scatter incoming solar and 
terrestrial radiation which not only modifies the temperature profiles of the 
atmosphere directly but also develops indirect effects on the cloud lifetime, 
cloud albedo and precipitation formation [@Sharif2015, 657f.]. Aerosols can act 
as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) leading to more and smaller droplets which 
increase the cloud albedo when a constant liquid water content is assumed [@Costantino2010, 1].
This is called the first indirect aerosol effect or “Twomey effect”. The second 
indirect effect (“Albrecht effect”) relates to the hydrological cycle by 
prolonging the cloud’s lifetime through the prevention of coalescence due to the 
increased number of droplets. Aerosols can suppress super-saturation within the 
clouds and thus lead to a reduction of precipitation rates [@Boucher2013, 606ff.].

In the semi-arid and arid regions of Central Asia, absorbing desert dust aerosols 
play a significant role for climate forcing as well as for cloud and precipitation 
formation [@Huang2014, 398f.]. Studies show that in Northern Africa and 
in parts of Central Asia mineral aerosols tend to inhibit precipitation [@Rosenfeld2001, 5975]. 
Over arid regions, they can even aggravate droughts through the effects of a 
feedback-loop as described by @Huang2014: While a high aerosol concentration 
causes more CCN and an increased number of cloud droplets for the available water 
vapour in the atmosphere, the suppressed coalescence and subsequent decrease of 
rainfall lead to a diminished soil moisture which in turn causes more dust storms. 
As a result, the cloud cover and water vapour are decreased with an increasing 
aerosol concentration, leading to expanding desertification [@Huang2014, 408f.].

In general, dust aerosols are relatively big particles with an Ångström Exponent
(AE) smaller than 1 and a low single scattering albedo (SSA) [@Huang2006a, 1ff.; @Mosmuller2012, 2f.]. 
A number of studies showed the presence of a strong seasonality in regard to 
aerosol concentration in Central Asia [@Ge2016, 62ff.; @Li2018, 2ff.]. The 
highest values occur in spring while the lowest concentrations have been measured 
in winter (ibid.). However, some studies also suggest the existence of spatial 
differences in the aerosol loadings next to patterns of temporal variability [@Alam2010, 1163ff.].
Furthermore, aerosol as well as cloud properties are said to follow a distinct 
seasonal cycle, which work in opposite directions underlining not only the 
temporal variability but also a possible connection between aerosols and cloud 
microphysics [@Rosenfeld2014, 752ff.].

The goal of the study is to analyse spatial and temporal variations of aerosols 
in the Aral Sea region and their correlation to cloud microphysical parameters. 
The analysis consists of the investigation of potential trends, their strength 
and direction in regard to individual aerosol and cloud properties. By using proxy
variables, namely AE and SSA, the dominating aerosol types and linked potential 
changes are narrowed down. Additionally, the study examines the 
relationship between aerosol and cloud properties which are discussed in the 
light of the theory of the first and second indirect aerosol effect. Based on 
the results of previous studies, MODIS time-series and correlation analyses are 
used to investigate the assumption that the aerosol concentration – described by
the aerosol optical depth (AOD) - rose significantly in the time period 2003 - 2018 [@Li2018, 1ff.].
Others have shown a clear spatial and temporal pattern for aerosols with the 
highest values to be found in spring [@Ge2016, 62ff.] as well as in the northern 
and central regions of the Aral Sea [@Li2018, 2f.]. There is some evidence of 
increasing particle sizes pictured by a decrease in AE over the course of time [@Sharif2015, 658f.]. 
Based on the chemical composition of dust aerosols seems to 
follow a decrease in SSA resulting in higher absorption of radiation [@Huang2014, 408ff.].
For other regions it has been shown that a stronger aerosol concentration and 
consequently increased CCN lead to a distinct cloud albedo and density (COT) 
while the cloud droplet size (CER) is reduced [@Alam2010, 1163]. Thus, AOD and 
CER have an opposed diurnal variation, while it is likewise for AOD and COT or CWP 
[@Rosenfeld2014, 752ff.]. On the other hand, the liquid water content (CWP) can
be enhanced through a higher amount of available water in the cloud. These 
assumptions help in presuming the presence of the first and second indirect effect 
[@Yin2002]. In contrast to these effects, a negative relationship between the AOD,
the CER and the CWP can emphasize the existence of a precipitation feedback-loop 
[@Huang2014, 408ff.]. This said, the result of the following analysis remains to be seen.

# Data and Methods
## Study area
The Aral Sea basin is located in the border region between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan 
(57 – 67 °E, 42 – 49 °N) and acts as the tail-end lake of the contributing rivers 
Amu Darya and Syr Darya (Figure 1). The study area is part of the global dust belt 
and shows typical features of a temperate continental climate with semi-arid to 
arid conditions. The summers are short and hot with a mean of 28.2 $^\circ C$ while 
winters are long and cold with a mean of -3.6 $^\circ C$. Precipitation rates are quite 
low with a mean of about 82.1 $mm/year$ and a maximum during winter [@Gaybull2012, 287]. 
Strong winds are often to be recorded in the study area [@Issanova2015, 3213f.].
The Aral Sea once has been the fourth largest lake on earth covering a water volume 
of 1.093 $km^3$ in 1960 [@Gaybull2012, 286]. Since then, it has been gradually 
shrinking due to overexploitation of its natural resources by water abstraction 
for irrigation agriculture as well as the impacts of climate change [@Ge2016, 2; @Shen2019, 2031].
In the year 2003, it finally split into eastern and western parts. 
The exposed lake bed consists of salt soils and loose sand dunes turning the 
former southern and western part of the lake into the Aralkum desert
[@Shen2019, 2031f.; @Shen2016, 624] which comprises of 57.500 $km^2$ [@Opp2019, 3].
The landscape is characterized by frequent salt and sand dust storms which may 
bear several threats to the ecosystem and local human’s health [@Ge2016, 4]. 
It has been stated that the spatial and temporal dust deposition variability 
is highly significant [@Opp2019, 1ff.].

```

## Satellite products
MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data currently is collected 
by two platforms (TERRA and AQUA) orbiting the Earth on a Sun-synchronous polar 
orbit. It measures solar and thermal radiation in 36 bands in resolutions ranging 
from 250 $m$ to 1 $km$. For this study, daily resolution Level-2 data were used for 
aerosol (MOD/MYD04) [@Levy2017] and cloud (MOD/MYD06) [@Platnick2017] parameters 
as well as the corresponding geolocation files (MOD/MYD03) [@Team2012]. 


### Aerosol properties
The aerosol parameters AOD, AE and SSA were retrieved based on the Deep Blue 
algorithm (DB) described by @Hsu2004 and @Hsu2006. DB uses wavelengths in the 
blue spectrum to overcome the phenomenon of absorbing aerosols darkening the 
reflectance measured at the sensor over bright surfaces making it more suitable 
for aerosol retrievals over bright surfaces such as deserts [@Hsu2004]. It is 
applied to clear-sky snow-free pixels over land only and uses the 412, 470/490, 650, 860, 1240 
and \linebreak 2110 $\mu m$ spectral bands on a final pixel size of 10 x 10 $km$ [@Hsu2013]. 

_Ångström Exponent (AE):_ AE is a wavelength depended parameter which is widely used 
as a qualitative measure of the particle size distribution of aerosols 
[@Soni2011; @Kang2015; @Yin2016; @Li2018; @Floutsi2019; @Rupakheti2019]. It is inversely related to
particle size with values $<=$ 1 indicating a dominating coarse-mode of aerosols 
land values $>$ 1 indicating the dominance of fine-mode aerosols [@Soni2011]. 
Depended on the wavelength the Angstrom exponent $\alpha$ is calculated according to Formula 1:
<br>
\begin{equation}
\tau _{a}(\lambda) = \beta (\lambda) - \alpha
\end{equation}

with:
$\tau _{a}$: AOD
$\lambda$:   wavelength
$\alpha$:    AE


In the MOD04 product $\alpha$ is calculated on the basis of the 412 and 470 $\mu m$ 
bands with the DB algorithm.


_Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA):_ The calculation 
of AOD and SSA is based on established lookup tables which are differentiated for 
several regions around the globe based on dominant aerosol modes found by empirical 
measurements [@Hsu2004]. Two different retrieval techniques can be applied: 
For moderate dust loadings with AOD < 0.7 the algorithm uses a two-channel 
technique to retrieve aerosol parameters based at 412 and 470/490 $\mu m$. Under 
heavy dust loadings with AOD > 0.7 a three-channel technique with the additional
670 $\mu m$ band may retrieve values for the combination 412  vs. 670 $\mu m$
and 470/490 vs. 670 $\mu m$. 

### Cloud properties
The algorithm to retrieve cloud optical and microphysical parameters at a nominal 
resolution of 1 $km$ makes use of the 645, 1640, 2130 and 3750 $\mu m$ channels over
land during daytime. It is applied to cloud overcast pixels only and differentiates 
the calculation according to the dominant phase of the cloud [@Baum2012]. 
Additionally, information of the surface albedo is included in the algorithm since
cloud reflectance is altered due to the underlying surface characteristics. 
Here, only the parameters describing the cloud’s microphysics (COT, CER and CWP) 
are extracted.

_Cloud Effective Radius (CER) and Cloud Optical Thickness (COT):_ CER and COT are 
derived from water-absorbing bands of MODIS (1.6, 2.1, 3.7 $\mu m$) coupled with 
non-absorbing bands (0.65, 0.86 and 1.2 $\mu m$) [@Platnick2003]. The algorithm 
uses a radiative transfer model to calculate a reflected intensity field for
combinations of CER and COT. Both parameters are then retrieved based on the measured
reflectance. With the introduction of the algorithm version C6 the retrieval of 
cloud parameters for optical thin clouds has been enabled [@Platnick2017]. 
For this study the data layers which retrieve CER and COT based on the relation 
between 2.1 $\mu m$ and 0.65, 0.86 and 1.2 $\mu m$ were used.

_Cloud Water Path (CWP):_ The CWP is directly linked to CER and COT and 
refers to the total liquid water amount found in the atmospheric column 
above a given pixel. It can be calculated in a simplified manner by use of Formula 2:

\begin{equation}
CWP = y * CER * COT
\end{equation}

This form of the calculation is beneficial for satellite-based measurements, 
since CWP can be estimated with information on COT and CER only. The term $y$ 
is either determined by adiabatic assumptions [@Wood2006] or the assumption of a 
vertically homogeneous water column [@Stephens1978] becoming either the ratio 
$^5/_9$ or $^2/_3$, respectively. 

## Methodology
The parameters are extracted from the MODIS data using the HEG-Tool (HDF-EOS To GeoTIFF Conversion Tool). 
It enables a selection of the cloud and aerosol properties clipping the data directly 
to the area of interest which is leaned on the shape of the study area used by [@Ge2016].
After aggregating the daily data to a monthly resolution, means for every season 
are calculated in order to detect inter-annual variability and linear trends. 
For each parameter, the long-term temporal dynamic between 2003 - 2018 is analysed 
as well as the seasonal variability by using boxplots of monthly and yearly mean values [@Li2018, 12]. 
The statistical analysis includes the trend detection to reveal the existence as 
well as the strength and direction of a possible change based on a seasonal 
resolution (Spring: March, April, May; Summer: June, July, August; Autumn: September,
October, November; Winter: December, January, February). For analysing the time 
series, the robust and non-parametric approach introduced by the Mann-Kendall 
test is used [@Li2018, 16]. This test is suitable for non-normal distributed 
data and therefore applicable for environmental data [@Kendall1975, 55ff.]. 
As the Mann-Kendall test only provides information on the existence of a trend, 
its strength and direction are analysed using a simple linear regression [@Li2014, 12273ff.]. 
The trend’s direction can be evaluated by the sign and the strength of its distance 
from 0. It is applied on a pixel basis for each season in order 
to detect spatial as well as temporal differences [@Alam2010, 1164ff.]. The 
relationship between the cloud and aerosol parameters is investigated through 
correlation tests [@Sharif2015, 657ff.]. Due to the missing conditions for 
using the Pearson correlation coefficient the method by Spearman is applied. 
The correlation coefficient is available in a standardised format between -1 and 1, 
with values at the end of the scale indicating a nearly perfect correlation [@Spearman1904, 72ff.]. 
The results of this analysis are presented on a pixel basis for each season to 
display spatial and temporal differences. Additionally, the correlation of all 
pixels is calculated to investigate the overall direction and strength of 
correlation between aerosol and cloud parameters [@Alam2010, 1170f.].

# Results
## Temporal and spatial variations

The depicted time period shows the long-term changes of the aerosol and cloud 
parameters from 2003-2018. The AOD pictures a yearly mean value between 0.1 – 0.3 
which at first increases until 2012 but decreases to the level of 2003 afterwards (Figure 2).
Also, the data show a high standard deviation with many outliers, especially for values of AOD > 0.5. 
In contrast, the course of the AE values is higher deviating with a mean between 1.1 – 1.3. 
While the AOD reaches its maximum values in 2012, the AE decreases from 2003 – 2011. 
Afterwards it slowly increases to a similar level as in the first year of the study 
period. The quantiles include a larger value range for the AE than the AOD while 
their standard deviation is less distinct. Both parameters do not show a monotonous 
trend. In contrast, for the SSA, a constant decrease over the course of the time 
period can be observed. In 2003, the mean of the SSA is at 0.93, while in 2018 it 
drops below 0.91. The standard deviation is broad throughout the study period (ibid.). 
The analysis of the monthly means pictures a distinct seasonal cycle for AOD, 
where values seem to be typically higher in spring and autumn than in summer and 
winter (Figure 3). Opposing the seasonal dynamic of AOD, the AE reaches its 
maximum in summer and winter. Spring and autumn are characterized by lower mean 
values. The SSA shows lower values from January to June with moderately increased 
values from July to December (ibid.). 

Concerning the long-term variations of the cloud properties, the values of all 
parameters show a high level of inter-annual variation in the depicted time period 
(Figure 4). The value range remains fairly constant for the entire period. 
COT and CWP show a very similar pattern of inter-annual variation, both reaching 
their highest mean value in 2009 (ibid.). CER values mostly range between 20 and 
24 microns with a maximum in 2008, while COT values vary between 15 – 24 and CWP 
values between 150-240 $g/m^2$. The analysis of the annual variability implies 
a more distinct seasonal pattern for COT and CER (Figure 5). In the transition 
seasons, COT reaches lower values than in summer and winter. In spring and summer, 
higher values lead to an expanded value span and standard deviation. The values of 
CER show an opposite seasonal cycle with the maximum in spring and autumn as well 
as the minimum in summer and winter. For CWP, a seasonal cycle is not as distinct 
since the values show a typical distribution but without a clear seasonal pattern.
In general, lower values go along with a smaller value range and vice versa (ibid.).

```

_Aerosol properties trend detection:_ The AOD is higher around and North-West of 
the Aral Sea with maximum values in spring and autumn (Figure 6). 
The long-term trend analysis shows an increasing trend close to the Aral Sea and 
Aralkum, while the values further away tend to decrease (Appendix, Figure 17). 
The slopes picture a rather small change for the mean values. 

```{r ae_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for AE for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_AE.png")
```

Contrary to this, the AE reaches its lowest values in spring and autumn, 
while the maximum appears in summer and winter (Figure 7). Overall, 
the AE increases with rising distance to Aral Sea. In spring and autumn, a great 
proportion of the areas East and West to the Aralkum show values of AE < 1.0. The 
trend detection depicts in spring, summer and winter mostly increasing values (Appendix, Figure 18). 
Only individual pixels show a significant increase especially in the East of the 
Aral Sea. In autumn, decreasing trends are dominating, but still can only be applied to 
the areas close to the lake surface and the Aralkum. 

```{r ssa_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for SSA for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_SSA.png")
```

The SSA shows a considerable spatial pattern with higher values around the Aral Sea 
(Figure 8). In the South and North-East of the study area, values are considerably 
lower. Especially in spring, there is a high variation between the individual 
regions. As for the trend detection, mostly decreasing trends are observed except 
for the spring season (Appendix, Figure 19). Close to the surface of the Aral Sea and 
the Aralkum, however, stronger increases in SSA are found during spring and autumn
and fewer steep decreases in summer and winter. In contrast to the other aerosol 
properties, most of the pixels are characterized by a significant detection of a 
linear decreasing long-term trend. In contrast, a monotonous trend detection for 
AOD and AE is not possible on a whole scale level. Here, significant trends only appear 
for individual pixels with a high spatial and temporal divergence. In addition, 
all slopes only display slight changes as the slopes are weakly defined.

knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_COT.png")
```

_Cloud properties trend detection:_ The COT depicts a seasonal cycle with lowest 
values in spring and autumn and higher values in summer and winter (Figure 9). 
During the latter ones, maximum values are reached in the southern region. 
The Aral Sea and the Aralkum are visible as regions with moderately lower values. 
The trend analysis shows the dominance of positive slopes in spring and autumn 
especially around the Aral Sea and Aralkum whereas values in the other seasons 
are rather decreasing (Appendix, Figure 20).  

```{r cer_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for CER [in microns] for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_CER.png")
```

Also, these regions are shown as well as a clear shape in all seasons for CER 
(Figure 10). They are characterized by very low values in contrast to the rest 
of the study area. Apart from that, values are generally higher in spring and 
autumn with the spatial maximum appearing in the North-East of the study area, 
while throughout all seasons lower values can be observed South-East and West 
of the Aral Sea’s surface. The trend analysis agrees with the pattern of a 
decreasing CER during spring, autumn and winter especially around the lake and 
the Aralkum (Appendix, Figure 21).

```{r cwp_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for CWP [in g/m2] for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_CWP.png")
```

Minimal values for CWP during all seasons are observed around the Aral Sea as 
well while they increase only in the South of the study area during summer and winter 
(Figure 11). No clear seasonal differences are observed, instead, a diverging 
seasonal pattern dominates (Appendix, Figure 22). During spring and autumn, there is a 
very diverse pattern of trends. The slopes are positive during summer and winter 
in close distance to the lake and the Aralkum. These pixels are the only ones 
showing a significant trend during these seasons, but the rest of the study 
area is otherwise characterized by a decreasing CWP. Like for the aerosol 
properties, a linear trend detection for all cloud properties on a whole scale 
level is not possible. Individual parameters imply the existence of a trend, 
but most pixels do not apply to the significance level.

## Relationship between aerosol and cloud properties

_Relationship between aerosol properties:_ The analysis of the relationship 
between AOD and AE shows a seasonal dependence with mainly a moderate to high 
negative correlation (Table 1). The spatial analysis implies mostly negative 
values for the study area with the strongest relationship in the central region. 
They tend to be generally stronger in spring and autumn. 

Close to the Aral Sea,there are some pixels showing a positive correlation, but 
only negative correlated pixels can be seen as statistically significant 
(Figure 12). The relationship between the AOD and SSA depicts an 
opposing and also weaker relationship, with more positive correlations and a 
higher spatial diversity (Table 1). However, again only negative correlations 
are found to be statistically significant especially during summer and autumn 
(Figure 13).

knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/cor_AOD_550_COT.png")
```

_Relationship between AOD and COT:_ The relationship between AOD and COT shows overall very low to low correlation coefficients (Table 1). Based on this a highly mixed distribution of negative and positive correlation coefficients can be identified. The variation makes it hard to find a clear pattern, though there is a band of significant negative correlations from the North-West to the South-East of the study area. Most pixels showing a negative sign are statistically significant, even though the overall strength of the relationship is questionable (Figure 14). 

```{r cor_aod_cer, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="65%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of correlation coefficient rho between AOD and CER during spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}

```

_Relationship between AOD and CER:_ The AOD and the CER have a generally low to medium negative correlation (Table 1). The spatial analysis shows only negative correlations to be statistically significant. They tend to occur mostly in the central region of the study area as well as North and East of the Aral Sea and the Aralkum (Figure 15). The strongest relationship is observed during in spring and autumn (ibid.).

knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/cor_AOD_550_CWP.png")
```
_Relationship between AOD and CWP:_ The relationship between AOD and the CWP is negative in total, with positive values only in spring. All values indicate a very low to low correlation (Table 1). The correlation maps show spatial highly deviating relationships with the highest values to be found North and West of the Aral Sea (Figure 16). Instead of a seasonal cycle, again a spatial pattern with a band of negative slopes on a highly significant level can be observed. Positive slopes rarely show significance throughout all seasons.


# Discussion

Most of the depicted parameters do not show a monotonous trend. Contrary to 
former assumptions, the aerosol concentration does not show a linear increase from 
2003 – 2018. While the size distribution reveals deviating values for AE, this proxy 
cannot be uniformly applied for estimating the aerosol type [@Huang2014, 400ff.]. 
Only in spring and autumn and together with an increasing absorption rate through 
decreasing SSA the hypotheses of dominating mineral dust is supported in some 
parts of the study area. For the cloud properties, no monotonous trend is visible. 
It is indicated that COT, CER and CWP are decreasing, but the statistical significance 
of these results is uncertain. Therefore, an analysis of the clouds microphysics is 
difficult. 
Also, the seasonal cycles which were assumed to fit together with the 
supposed relationships between aerosol and cloud properties do not overlap. 
Instead, the relationships between the individual parameters display rather weak correlations. 
In contrast to other studies in similar regions of Central Asia which obtained 
stronger results, their information value needs to be reconsidered [@Alam2010, 1165ff.; @Sharif2015, 660ff.]. 

In addition, the first and second indirect aerosol effect were analysed. 
Together with a rising AOD, a lower CER and an increasing COT, the Twomey effect 
may be assumed [@Huang2014, 406ff.]. The existence of the second indirect effect 
was investigated inspecting the correlation between AOD and CWP (ibid.). 
For small parts of the region – especially around the Aralkum – these hypotheses 
seem to be applicable. There are hints for a precipitation feedback loop because 
of the overall negative correlation between AOD and the cloud properties. But 
since the data show a tremendous variability in parameter’s relationships and 
overall mostly low correlations, no definite statement for answering the scientific 
question is possible. The hypotheses set before can be neither confirmed nor denied. 
The analysis illustrates the complexity and difficulty of aerosol-cloud interactions as
most relationships cannot be explained by merely the correlation coefficients 
used in this study. As pictured before, the aerosol cloud interactions demonstrate 
a high spatial and temporal variability with generally stronger characteristics 
in spring and autumn. Since all results cannot be confirmed for the whole study 
area and every parameter, they need to be treated with caution.

Instead, the influence of other parameters becomes apparent. These include not 
only meteorological conditions [@Sharif2015, 657], but also the importance of external 
effects [@Huang2006a, 4]. Mesoscale convective systems may cover local processes 
and can disguise the origin of interacting factors [@Sharif2015, 660ff.]. 
As no trajectory analysis is included, the origin of the aerosols stays unknown (ibid.). 
Furthermore, changes in the land use, e.g. through irrigation, may lead to more 
greening and less aerosol deposition, thus modifying the correlation results [@Jin2017, 2f.]. 
Also, the vertical structure of the clouds is an important feature in order to 
analyse the effects of aerosols on their hydrological cycle. Regarding these, 
the analysis needs to include more precise parameters to ensure reliable results 
[@Costantino2010, 4f.; @Li2018, 22ff.]. 
Apart from that the aggregation of the data can lead to an over- or 
underestimation of the estimated effects [@Sayer2013, 7864ff.]. In addition, 
the dimension of the existing retrieval bias in the MODIS data caused by the 
water surface of the Aral Sea stays unknown thus not the leading to strictest 
results [@Jin2017, 9f.]. Nevertheless, there seems to be potential for optimizing [@Li2018, 22ff.].
The combination of instrumental and spatial difficulties inhibits a more detailed 
statement in regard to answering the scientific questions and hypotheses assumed before.
This said, it is necessary to include a variety of possible influences in the 
analysis as well as taking further investigations in the cloud microphysical 
properties. Future research needs to take a closer look at the changes in the 
hydrological cycle: the feedback loop for rainfall rates may be implied, but 
its dimension and quantification in the region remain unclear. 

# Conclusion

As a result, the quantification of the aerosol-cloud interaction in the Aral Sea 
region includes several difficulties in gaining a reliable output. An accurate 
answer for the scientific questions needs to be replaced by a first approximation. 
The existence of a relationship between most of the aerosol and cloud properties can 
be assumed, but their strength, direction and possible consequences need to be 
further investigated. The results of this study may provide an overview for a 
study area that has not been object of this kind of research before. The problems 
that occurred can be led back to either instrumental and methodical issues or the 
complexity of natural processes. As the study itself dealt with a highly relevant 
topic many uncertainties in dealing with cloud microphysics still exist to this point. 
It is a future challenge to pursue solutions to these obstacles. Especially in highly 
vulnerable regions like the Aral Sea, changes in the hydrological pattern originating 
to aerosol concentration alterations may inhabit considerable threats to humans and 
nature, e.g. the expansion of deserts and ongoing salinization. Therefore, an 
estimation of precipitation patterns and shifts as well as the clouds vertical 
structure and more precise aerosol type analyses are crucial for future research.
