# Introduction
In the last years, an increasing scientific interest has been awoken in terms of 
the interaction between aerosols and the elements of the hydrological cycle 
[@Ng2017, 1]. Precipitation patterns and their influence on human’s 
living environment can be connected with a variety of ecological, economic and 
social challenges on different spatial extents [@Boucher2013, 573 ff.]. 
Especially in semi-arid and arid regions changes in rainfall rates can affect 
health of local residents [@Issanova2015, 3213ff.]. Where water is an 
already scarce resource, further decreases will promote rising vulnerability to 
external threats (ibid.). Regarding this, the Aral Sea region can be seen as a 
first-class example for investigations between aerosols and rainfall activities 
[@Shen2019, 1]. With the desertification of the Aral Sea it has been 
subject to substantial changes in terms of water availability 
[@Groll2019, 1]. Deserts contain a high proportion of mineral aerosols, 
which may initiate climatological mechanisms of high complexity and, ultimately, 
a shift in precipitation rates [@Boucher2013, 573 ff.]. Still, it is hard 
to quantify the effects on other environmental parameters [@Ng2017, 1]. 
The relationship between aerosols and cloud microphysics as well as precipitation 
patterns remains one of the biggest uncertainties in climate studies [@Altaratz2013, 1].
Aerosols play a major role in changes of the earth’s energy budget 
[@Ng2017, 1] and can be seen as an important component of global 
climate [@Carrico2003, 1]. There exist four major terrestrial sources for 
atmospheric aerosols which, based on their chemical composition, either absorb 
or scatter incoming solar and terrestrial radiation [@Sharif2015, 657f]. 
These direct effects may cool the surface and affect evaporation 
[@Ng2017, 1]. Also, aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) 
leading to more and smaller droplets, which is called the first indirect aerosol 
effect [@Costantino2010, 1]. The result is a suppression of 
precipitation, while the second indirect effect prolongs the cloud’s lifetime 
through the prevention of coalescence favouring the occurrence of extreme events 
[@Ng2017, 2]. By heating the cloud, the coverage area is reduced, 
again leading to a higher amount of radiation on the ground. This attenuates 
surface evaporation and further decreases rainfall (ibid.). A number of studies 
showed the presence of a strong seasonality in regard to aerosol concentration 
in Central Asia [@Ge2016, 62ff.;@Li2018, 2ff.]. The highest 
values occur in spring while the lowest concentrations have been measured in 
winter (ibid.). However, some studies suggest the indicated perturbation of the 
hydrological cycle to be more distinct in some places than in others [@Ng2017, 2].
The goal of this study is to analyse temporal and spatial variations of aerosols 
in the Aral Sea region in relation to precipitation patterns. Following a prior 
seminar work regarding the analysis of aerosol and cloud microphysical properties, 
it continues striving for an adequate estimation of the relationship between 
hydro-climatological parameters. Therefore, the analysis consists of the 
investigation of potential trends, their strength and direction in regard to 
aerosol concentration to rainfall rates. In order to display the overall 
effects, cloud microphysical parameters will be included as well as the 
atmosphere’s relative humidity because of its critical role on rainfall 
variability [@Altaratz2013, 1f.; @Carrico2003, 2]. Some studies 
suggest high rain rates to be associated with a rising aerosol concentration 
[@Boucher2013, 4]. Otherwise, contrary results have been observed as 
well [@Ng2017, 1ff.]. In general, time and space seem to be crucial 
[@Grandey2014, 5678ff.]. The hygroscopicity of aerosols cause the 
relative humidity to be one of the most important drivers for the observed 
relationship between AOD and rainfall [@Ng2017, 2f.]. When it 
reaches a certain concentration, it can alter the results of correlation 
analyses mainly through two effects [@Altaratz2013, 1f.]. First, relative 
humidity may cause, dependend on the aerosols’ chemical properties, substantial 
growth of the particles in an humid environment [@Carrico2003, 1], 
leading to coalescence of the droplets [@Ng2017, 2ff.]. This 
depicts a rather positive relation between the variables 
[@Grandey2014, 5678]. Second, wet scavenging of aerosols through rainfall 
can occur in a mostly convective environment [@Grandey2014, 5680ff.]. It 
acts as an aerosol sink and results in a negative relationship between the 
aerosol concentration and precipitation or rather relative humidity (ibid.). 
Consequently, a negative correlation may not only reflect suppressed 
precipitation [@Ng2017, 9]. Both effects demonstrate the importance 
of the atmospheres’ humidity in questions of aerosol-precipitation relationships 
and thus will be evaluated in the following study.

# Data and Methods
## Study area
The Aral Sea basin is located in the border region between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan 
(57 – 67 °E, 42 – 49 °N) and acts as the tail-end lake of the contributing rivers 
Amu Darya and Syr Darya (Figure 1). The study area is part of the global dust belt 
and shows typical features of a temperate continental climate with semi-arid to 
arid conditions. The summers are short and hot with a mean of 28.2 $^\circ C$ while 
winters are long and cold with a mean of -3.6 $^\circ C$. Precipitation rates are quite 
low with a mean of about 82.1 $mm/year$ and a maximum during winter [@Gaybull2012, 287]. 
Strong winds are often to be recorded in the study area [@Issanova2015, 3213f.].
The Aral Sea once has been the fourth largest lake on earth covering a water volume 
of 1.093 $km^3$ in 1960 [@Gaybull2012, 286]. Since then, it has been gradually 
shrinking due to overexploitation of its natural resources by water abstraction 
for irrigation agriculture as well as the impacts of climate change [@Ge2016, 2; @Shen2019, 2031].
In the year 2003, it finally split into eastern and western parts. 
The exposed lake bed consists of salt soils and loose sand dunes turning the 
former southern and western part of the lake into the Aralkum desert
[@Shen2019, 2031f.; @Shen2016, 624] which comprises of 57.500 $km^2$ [@Opp2019, 3].
The landscape is characterized by frequent salt and sand dust storms which may 
bear several threats to the ecosystem and local human’s health [@Ge2016, 4]. 
It has been stated that the spatial and temporal dust deposition variability 
is highly significant [@Opp2019, 1ff.].

```

## Satellite products
MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data currently is collected 
by two platforms (TERRA and AQUA) orbiting the Earth on a Sun-synchronous polar 
orbit. It measures solar and thermal radiation in 36 bands in resolutions ranging 
from 250 $m$ to 1 $km$. For this study, daily resolution Level-2 data were used for 
aerosol (MOD/MYD04) [@Levy2017] and cloud (MOD/MYD06) [@Platnick2017] parameters 
as well as the corresponding geolocation files (MOD/MYD03) [@Team2012]. 


### Aerosol properties
The aerosol optical depth (AOD) were retrieved from the MOD/MYD04 data product based on the Deep Blue 
algorithm (DB) described by @Hsu2004 and @Hsu2006. DB uses wavelengths in the 
blue spectrum to overcome the phenomenon of absorbing aerosols darkening the 
reflectance measured at the sensor over bright surfaces making it more suitable 
for aerosol retrievals over bright surfaces such as deserts [@Hsu2004]. It is 
applied to clear-sky snow-free pixels over land only and uses the 412, 470/490, 650, 860, 1240 
and \linebreak 2110 $\mu m$ spectral bands on a final pixel size of 10 x 10 $km$ [@Hsu2013]. 

_Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD):_ The calculation 
of AOD is based on a established lookup table which differentiates for 
several regions around the globe based on dominant aerosol modes found by empirical 
measurements [@Hsu2004]. Two different retrieval techniques can be applied: 
For moderate dust loadings with AOD < 0.7 the algorithm uses a two-channel 
technique to retrieve aerosol parameters based at 412 and 470/490 $\mu m$. Under 
heavy dust loadings with AOD > 0.7 a three-channel technique with the additional
670 $\mu m$ band may retrieve values for the combination 412  vs. 670 $\mu m$
and 470/490 vs. 670 $\mu m$. 

### Cloud properties
The algorithm to retrieve cloud optical and microphysical parameters at a nominal 
resolution of 1 $km$ makes use of the 645, 1640, 2130 and 3750 $\mu m$ channels over
land during daytime. It is applied to cloud overcast pixels only and differentiates 
the calculation according to the dominant phase of the cloud [@Baum2012]. 
Additionally, information of the surface albedo is included in the algorithm since
cloud reflectance is altered due to the underlying surface characteristics. 
Here, only the parameters describing the cloud’s microphysics (COT, CER and CWP) 
are extracted.

_Cloud Effective Radius (CER) and Cloud Optical Thickness (COT):_ CER and COT are 
derived from water-absorbing bands of MODIS (1.6, 2.1, 3.7 $\mu m$) coupled with 
non-absorbing bands (0.65, 0.86 and 1.2 $\mu m$) [@Platnick2003]. The algorithm 
uses a radiative transfer model to calculate a reflected intensity field for
combinations of CER and COT. Both parameters are then retrieved based on the measured
reflectance. With the introduction of the algorithm version C6 the retrieval of 
cloud parameters for optical thin clouds has been enabled [@Platnick2017]. 
For this study the data layers which retrieve CER and COT based on the relation 
between 2.1 $\mu m$ and 0.65, 0.86 and 1.2 $\mu m$ were used.

_Cloud Water Path (CWP):_ The CWP is directly linked to CER and COT and 
refers to the total liquid water amount found in the atmospheric column 
above a given pixel. It can be calculated in a simplified manner by use of Formula 2:

\begin{equation}
CWP = y * CER * COT
\end{equation}

This form of the calculation is beneficial for satellite-based measurements, 
since CWP can be estimated with information on COT and CER only. The term $y$ 
is either determined by adiabatic assumptions [@Wood2006] or the assumption of a 
vertically homogeneous water column [@Stephens1978] becoming either the ratio 
$^5/_9$ or $^2/_3$, respectively.

### Precipitation
_Precipitation (P):_ Monthly sums of precipitation are derived from the CHIRPS
dataset. This dataset is established by taking long-term monthly average data
from ground stations in conjunction with observations from five satellite missions
to establish a local regression model with a moving window for each grid cell of
0.05° in size [@Funk2015, 3f.]. The independent variables in the local regressions
consist always of the longitude and latidue information as well as one to three additional
variables representing either the local elevation, the slope or satelite observations.
Potential residuals in comparison to the FAO climate normals are interpolated
using inverse distance weighting and are than added to the local estimates [@Funk2015, 3].
In a last step, for every pixel the five nearest ground stations are used to apply
another inverse distance weighting algorithm. Here, an estimate of the decorrelation slope
from the predicted precipitation and the observed precipitation at the neighbouring stations
are used to calculated a weighted average [@Funk2015, 3].

### Relative Humidity
_Relative Humidity (RH):_ RH is retrived using the ERA-5 reanalysis dataset processed by
the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [@Forecasts2017]. 
This dataset combines observations and model predictions to get a comprehensive 
model of global atmospheric conditions at small time steps and a nominal resoultion
of 31km at the ground, however the data has been regridded to 0.25°. The atmosphere 
is modeled in 137 vertical levels from the surface to 1 Pa. Here, we used the 
monthly aggregates of RH only for the first seven atmospheric layers (1000 hPa - 850 hPa) 
since the other datasets were also summarized to monthly aggregates. 850 Pa was 
considered an appropiate height level, since local aerosol trasnports in the region
are merely reported to be found above 5 km in height [@Chen2013]. 

## Methodology
AOD and the cloud parameters were extracted from the respective MODIS datasets 
using the HEG-Tool (HDF-EOS To GeoTIFF Conversion Tool). It enables a selection of the 
cloud and aerosol properties clipping the data directly to the area of interest which 
is leaned on the shape of the study area used by [@Ge2016]. The cloud parameters
(at 6km nominal resoultion) were resampled to the 10km nominal resoultion of the AOD
dataset. 
The observations of single MODIS overflights were then aggregated to a monthly 
temporal-resolution, and means were calculated for four different seasons 
(Spring: March, April, May; Summer: June, July, August; Autumn: September, October, 
November; Winter: December, January, February) 
for every year between 2003 to 2018.

The CHIRPS dataset already represents monthly aggregates. The cell values were resampled
to the 10km resoultion of the MODIS data and seasonal aggregates were calculated as described
above. For RH, the process was basically identical, except that the median was 
calculated across the seven vertival layers, before the data was resampled to the 
same resoultion as the other datasets.

To retrieve the correlation between AOD and P and to generate insights to the underlying
processes we conduct a number of correlation analysis between these two parameters,
while eleminating the influence of cloud parameteres and RH. For this approach,
we firstly cheked if the data fullfills the assumptions to calcualte Pearsons correlation.
All variables are continous in form. Pearsons correlation additionally is sensitive
for outliers. Similiarily to other studys we thus excluded exceptional high AOD values
above 0.3. Also, we assume linear relationships between the variables for values below the 
AOD threshold of 0.3. We then calculated the correlation coefficient betwenn AOD and P
while controlling for any other variable. This is achieved by calculating the partial correlation. 
Partial correlation is used as a measure of the linear dependence between two variables 
while controlling for the influences of a third.
In fact, not the original values of AOD and P are fitted, but rather the residuals
which were calculated by using the control variable as a predictor. Thus, only the 
proportion of variance which cannot be explained by the control variable is subject to the
correlation analysis [@Salkind2010].
This approach has been chosen by a number of recent studies investigating relationships
between aerosols and cloud microphysics as well as precipitations and seems reasonable to 
achive both, investigating the "true" realtionship between AOD and P in a complex field
of interviening processes and effects and to deliver indications for the dominant processes
driving this relationship [@Engstrom2010; @Gryspeerdt2014; @Ng2017].

The results of this analysis are presented on a pixel basis for each season to 
display spatial and temporal differences. Additionally, the correlation of all 
pixels which show a significant relationship at the 95% confidence interval 
is calculated to investigate the overall direction and strength of 
correlation between aerosol and cloud parameters [@Alam2010, 1170f.].

# Results
## Temporal and spatial variations

The temporal and spatial variations of several aerosol and cloud parameters have been presented
in the previous seminar paper. Here, we only represent the additional parameters P
and RH.

```
\end{landscape}


_Aerosol properties trend detection:_ The AOD is higher around and North-West of 
the Aral Sea with maximum values in spring and autumn (Figure 6). 
The long-term trend analysis shows an increasing trend close to the Aral Sea and 
Aralkum, while the values further away tend to decrease (Appendix, Figure 17). 
The slopes picture a rather small change for the mean values. 

```{r ae_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for AE for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_AE.png")
```

Contrary to this, the AE reaches its lowest values in spring and autumn, 
while the maximum appears in summer and winter (Figure 7). Overall, 
the AE increases with rising distance to Aral Sea. In spring and autumn, a great 
proportion of the areas East and West to the Aralkum show values of AE < 1.0. The 
trend detection depicts in spring, summer and winter mostly increasing values (Appendix, Figure 18). 
Only individual pixels show a significant increase especially in the East of the 
Aral Sea. In autumn, decreasing trends are dominating, but still can only be applied to 
the areas close to the lake surface and the Aralkum. 

```{r ssa_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for SSA for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_SSA.png")
```

The SSA shows a considerable spatial pattern with higher values around the Aral Sea 
(Figure 8). In the South and North-East of the study area, values are considerably 
lower. Especially in spring, there is a high variation between the individual 
regions. As for the trend detection, mostly decreasing trends are observed except 
for the spring season (Appendix, Figure 19). Close to the surface of the Aral Sea and 
the Aralkum, however, stronger increases in SSA are found during spring and autumn
and fewer steep decreases in summer and winter. In contrast to the other aerosol 
properties, most of the pixels are characterized by a significant detection of a 
linear decreasing long-term trend. In contrast, a monotonous trend detection for 
AOD and AE is not possible on a whole scale level. Here, significant trends only appear 
for individual pixels with a high spatial and temporal divergence. In addition, 
all slopes only display slight changes as the slopes are weakly defined.


```{r cot_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for COT for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_COT.png")
```

_Cloud properties trend detection:_ The COT depicts a seasonal cycle with lowest 
values in spring and autumn and higher values in summer and winter (Figure 9). 
During the latter ones, maximum values are reached in the southern region. 
The Aral Sea and the Aralkum are visible as regions with moderately lower values. 
The trend analysis shows the dominance of positive slopes in spring and autumn 
especially around the Aral Sea and Aralkum whereas values in the other seasons 
are rather decreasing (Appendix, Figure 20).  

```{r cer_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for CER [in microns] for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_CER.png")
```

Also, these regions are shown as well as a clear shape in all seasons for CER 
(Figure 10). They are characterized by very low values in contrast to the rest 
of the study area. Apart from that, values are generally higher in spring and 
autumn with the spatial maximum appearing in the North-East of the study area, 
while throughout all seasons lower values can be observed South-East and West 
of the Aral Sea’s surface. The trend analysis agrees with the pattern of a 
decreasing CER during spring, autumn and winter especially around the lake and 
the Aralkum (Appendix, Figure 21).

```{r cwp_seasonal, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="60%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of seasonal means for CWP [in g/m2] for spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/seasonal_means_CWP.png")
```

Minimal values for CWP during all seasons are observed around the Aral Sea as 
well while they increase only in the South of the study area during summer and winter 
(Figure 11). No clear seasonal differences are observed, instead, a diverging 
seasonal pattern dominates (Appendix, Figure 22). During spring and autumn, there is a 
very diverse pattern of trends. The slopes are positive during summer and winter 
in close distance to the lake and the Aralkum. These pixels are the only ones 
showing a significant trend during these seasons, but the rest of the study 
area is otherwise characterized by a decreasing CWP. Like for the aerosol 
properties, a linear trend detection for all cloud properties on a whole scale 
level is not possible. Individual parameters imply the existence of a trend, 
but most pixels do not apply to the significance level.

\newpage

## Relationship between aerosol and cloud properties

_Relationship between aerosol properties:_ The analysis of the relationship 
between AOD and AE shows a seasonal dependence with mainly a moderate to high 
negative correlation (Table 1). The spatial analysis implies mostly negative 
values for the study area with the strongest relationship in the central region. 
They tend to be generally stronger in spring and autumn. 

Close to the Aral Sea,there are some pixels showing a positive correlation, but 
only negative correlated pixels can be seen as statistically significant 
(Figure 12). The relationship between the AOD and SSA depicts an 
opposing and also weaker relationship, with more positive correlations and a 
higher spatial diversity (Table 1). However, again only negative correlations 
are found to be statistically significant especially during summer and autumn 
(Figure 13).

knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/cor_AOD_550_COT.png")
```

_Relationship between AOD and COT:_ The relationship between AOD and COT shows overall very low to low correlation coefficients (Table 1). Based on this a highly mixed distribution of negative and positive correlation coefficients can be identified. The variation makes it hard to find a clear pattern, though there is a band of significant negative correlations from the North-West to the South-East of the study area. Most pixels showing a negative sign are statistically significant, even though the overall strength of the relationship is questionable (Figure 14). 

```{r cor_aod_cer, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="65%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of correlation coefficient rho between AOD and CER during spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/cor_AOD_550_CER.png")
```

_Relationship between AOD and CER:_ The AOD and the CER have a generally low to medium negative correlation (Table 1). The spatial analysis shows only negative correlations to be statistically significant. They tend to occur mostly in the central region of the study area as well as North and East of the Aral Sea and the Aralkum (Figure 15). The strongest relationship is observed during in spring and autumn (ibid.).

```{r cor_aod_cwp, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", out.width="65%", fig.cap="Spatial distribution of correlation coefficient rho between AOD and CWP during spring (a), summer (b), autumn (c), and winter (d).", dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plots/cor_AOD_550_CWP.png")
```
_Relationship between AOD and CWP:_ The relationship between AOD and the CWP is negative in total, with positive values only in spring. All values indicate a very low to low correlation (Table 1). The correlation maps show spatial highly deviating relationships with the highest values to be found North and West of the Aral Sea (Figure 16). Instead of a seasonal cycle, again a spatial pattern with a band of negative slopes on a highly significant level can be observed. Positive slopes rarely show significance throughout all seasons.


# Discussion

Most of the depicted parameters do not show a monotonous trend. Contrary to 
former assumptions, the aerosol concentration does not show a linear increase from 
2003 – 2018. While the size distribution reveals deviating values for AE, this proxy 
cannot be uniformly applied for estimating the aerosol type [@Huang2014, 400ff.]. 
Only in spring and autumn and together with an increasing absorption rate through 
decreasing SSA the hypotheses of dominating mineral dust is supported in some 
parts of the study area. For the cloud properties, no monotonous trend is visible. 
It is indicated that COT, CER and CWP are decreasing, but the statistical significance 
of these results is uncertain. Therefore, an analysis of the clouds microphysics is 
difficult. 
Also, the seasonal cycles which were assumed to fit together with the 
supposed relationships between aerosol and cloud properties do not overlap. 
Instead, the relationships between the individual parameters display rather weak correlations. 
In contrast to other studies in similar regions of Central Asia which obtained 
stronger results, their information value needs to be reconsidered [@Alam2010, 1165ff.; @Sharif2015, 660ff.]. 

In addition, the first and second indirect aerosol effect were analysed. 
Together with a rising AOD, a lower CER and an increasing COT, the Twomey effect 
may be assumed [@Huang2014, 406ff.]. The existence of the second indirect effect 
was investigated inspecting the correlation between AOD and CWP (ibid.). 
For small parts of the region – especially around the Aralkum – these hypotheses 
seem to be applicable. There are hints for a precipitation feedback loop because 
of the overall negative correlation between AOD and the cloud properties. But 
since the data show a tremendous variability in parameter’s relationships and 
overall mostly low correlations, no definite statement for answering the scientific 
question is possible. The hypotheses set before can be neither confirmed nor denied. 
The analysis illustrates the complexity and difficulty of aerosol-cloud interactions as
most relationships cannot be explained by merely the correlation coefficients 
used in this study. As pictured before, the aerosol cloud interactions demonstrate 
a high spatial and temporal variability with generally stronger characteristics 
in spring and autumn. Since all results cannot be confirmed for the whole study 
area and every parameter, they need to be treated with caution.

Instead, the influence of other parameters becomes apparent. These include not 
only meteorological conditions [@Sharif2015, 657], but also the importance of external 
effects [@Huang2006a, 4]. Mesoscale convective systems may cover local processes 
and can disguise the origin of interacting factors [@Sharif2015, 660ff.]. 
As no trajectory analysis is included, the origin of the aerosols stays unknown (ibid.). 
Furthermore, changes in the land use, e.g. through irrigation, may lead to more 
greening and less aerosol deposition, thus modifying the correlation results [@Jin2017, 2f.]. 
Also, the vertical structure of the clouds is an important feature in order to 
analyse the effects of aerosols on their hydrological cycle. Regarding these, 
the analysis needs to include more precise parameters to ensure reliable results 
[@Costantino2010, 4f.; @Li2018, 22ff.]. 
Apart from that the aggregation of the data can lead to an over- or 
underestimation of the estimated effects [@Sayer2013, 7864ff.]. In addition, 
the dimension of the existing retrieval bias in the MODIS data caused by the 
water surface of the Aral Sea stays unknown thus not the leading to strictest 
results [@Jin2017, 9f.]. Nevertheless, there seems to be potential for optimizing [@Li2018, 22ff.].
The combination of instrumental and spatial difficulties inhibits a more detailed 
statement in regard to answering the scientific questions and hypotheses assumed before.
This said, it is necessary to include a variety of possible influences in the 
analysis as well as taking further investigations in the cloud microphysical 
properties. Future research needs to take a closer look at the changes in the 
hydrological cycle: the feedback loop for rainfall rates may be implied, but 
its dimension and quantification in the region remain unclear. 

# Conclusion

As a result, the quantification of the aerosol-cloud interaction in the Aral Sea 
region includes several difficulties in gaining a reliable output. An accurate 
answer for the scientific questions needs to be replaced by a first approximation. 
The existence of a relationship between most of the aerosol and cloud properties can 
be assumed, but their strength, direction and possible consequences need to be 
further investigated. The results of this study may provide an overview for a 
study area that has not been object of this kind of research before. The problems 
that occurred can be led back to either instrumental and methodical issues or the 
complexity of natural processes. As the study itself dealt with a highly relevant 
topic many uncertainties in dealing with cloud microphysics still exist to this point. 
It is a future challenge to pursue solutions to these obstacles. Especially in highly 
vulnerable regions like the Aral Sea, changes in the hydrological pattern originating 
to aerosol concentration alterations may inhabit considerable threats to humans and 
nature, e.g. the expansion of deserts and ongoing salinization. Therefore, an 
estimation of precipitation patterns and shifts as well as the clouds vertical 
structure and more precise aerosol type analyses are crucial for future research.
